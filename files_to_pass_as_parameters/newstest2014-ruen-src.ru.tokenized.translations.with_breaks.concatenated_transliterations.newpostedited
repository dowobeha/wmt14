the remaining survivors and relatives of 202 died as a result of the bombing in bali in 2002 , reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the conspirators , who appeared before the court and stated that umar patek should be shot .
patek , who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in south-east asia , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building the explosive devices used in the attack .
he could be freed within 15 years if she gets parole .
45th and the defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of attacks on two night club in the popular tourist area of kuta , during which killed 202 people , including 88 australians , and injured dozens more .
he was also found guilty on a number of other charges related to terrorism , including in a wave of bombings of churches across indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
prosecutors have demanded life imprisonment , although they could insist that the man , nicknamed “ the master подрывником__podryvnikom ” for his reputation for making explosives , should be sentenced to death .
this decision has painful memories of the mother from perth june кортин__kortin , which lost its 39-летних__39-letnikh дочерей-близнецов__docherey-bliznetsov jane and jenny in the terrorist attack , and his осуществленном__osushchestvlennom патеком__patekom сообщниками__soobshchnikami almost ten years ago .
barely concealing his own tears , she said that patek was supposed to be sentenced to death .
“ i really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of other guys .
he must appear before расстрельной__rasstrelnoy team , ” said ms. кортин__kortin aap .
“ i have to live every day knowing that i will no longer be grandchildren and i don ’ t see my daughters . ”
“ the sari club ” was destroyed when it was set in motion a massive explosive device , implicit in a van parked outside , just after 11 p.m. on october 12 , 2002 .
peter hughes was in the bar “ paddy ” , where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack , with a ton of explosives , only 20 seconds earlier .
after that attack , he fell into a coma and a month “ died ” three times , being connected to a life-support system .
mr hughes said that patek should share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell of jemaah islamiyah , responsible for a bloodbath — амрози__amrozi , мухласа__mukhlasa and imam самудры__samudry who were executed four years ago .
indeed , this guy deserves the death penalty all the more .
to save his life , well , there is no reason to save his life .
get 20 years after killed 202 people and wounded hundreds is not so much .
patek is the last of the terrorist attack in bali , представшим__predstavshim before a court of law .
he was hiding for almost a decade , but in the end was arrested in january 2011 in the pakistani town of abbottabad , where u.s. forces killed former al qaeda boss osama bin laden less than four months later .
during the trial , an fbi agent testified that the intelligence testified : patek was in pakistan to meet bin laden in an attempt to restore the ties between southeast asian terrorist groups and al-qaeda .
“ he didn ’ t give up , ” said ms. кортин__kortin .
until recently he regretted nothing about how much grief he caused others .
the judge in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack , which will be celebrated later this year in bali and australia .
“ this year there will be a lot of tears , ” said ms. кортин__kortin .
patek can still appeal his sentence .

the manufacturers of jet aircraft feud over seat width , when large orders at stake
between the leading manufacturers of aircraft inflamed violent dispute about the width of the tourist class seats on long flights , setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the dubai air show this month .
the dispute focuses on the dynamic of the width of the seats available to passengers on long-haul flights in economy class , whose interests are not always the centre of attention of the airlines , with the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in statements about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by boeing co and airbus sas .
airbus this week called for the introduction of industry standard , which would have included the width of the seat at least 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in economy class salons , but its main american rival , boeing says it must solve the airline .
the dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of increasingly large versions of their двухмоторных__dvukhmotornykh long-haul aircraft and 17 at the event – 21 november expected potentially record orders .
the layout of the rear part of the plane — especially the sitting whether 9 or 10 people in a row — occupies a central place in statements about the economic performance of new projects “ мини-аэробусов__mini-aerobusov . ”
boeing argues that its new 777x will be reduced to 406 people on the basis of seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width , placed on the 10 in each row .
airbus says that its competing version of the a350 will be transported in эконом-классе__ekonom-klasse 350 people on seats 18 inches wide , located on nine in a row .
aircraft manufacturing giants often exchanged blows on technical issues with the help of professional advertising in the press .
and now , airbus is appealing directly to the public before авиашоу__aviashou in dubai , where the 777x , is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders .
she recently demonstrated what may be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing financiers slide , representing three people in the restaurant , прижатых__prizhatykh to each other , titled “ you would agree to that ? ”
“ boeing offers дальнемагистральные__dalnemagistralnye flights on seats narrower than the regional turboprop aircraft , ” said airbus sales chief john лихи__likhi .
with the change of diet of people gaining weight , but самолетные__samoletnye seats have not changed dramatically .
between the beginning of the 1970s , when the wide-body boeing 747 asked modern standards and long-distance travel abroad century average weight of american men aged 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent , according to the department of health of the united states .
обхват__obkhvat waist of the average american male of the 21st century is 39.7 inches , according to the statistics of the u.s. public health service .
airbus says that its rival is committed to the concept of the seats of the 1950s , when the average waist обхват__obkhvat those recently called “ reactive ” , the audience was already .
airbus says that ordered a study indicating that an extra inch in seat width improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent .
boeing disputed airbus figures on the size of seats and said that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find balance between tariffs and amenities .
she said studies show that the convenience of salon depends not only on the width of the seats .
“ it really comes down to providing airlines choice and the opportunity to do what they believe they need to do to succeed , ” said specialist boeing on saloon kent крейвер__kreyver .
they do not want us to be solved for them that will bring them profits .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for passengers , the question is to increase the space on the sides , but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits .
behind this dispute is the race for orders for planes , at least in the $ 700 billion on каталожным__katalozhnym prices in the coming decades — enough to change the balance of the american and european exports .
as first reported by reuters in july the agency , the location of the seats is what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest reactive aircraft .
both airbus and boeing , as well as announcing 20-процентном__20-protsentnom improving profitability at one place in their latest long-haul двухмоторных__dvukhmotornykh models compared with the market leader in this segment , 365-местным__365-mestnym boeing 777-300er .
the claimed characteristics of boeing are based in part on comparing 10-местных__10-mestnykh rows 777x with original 9-местной__9-mestnoy layout of constructive solutions 777 .
the win in the specific cost decreases when compared with 10-местной__10-mestnoy layout used currently .
“ the reason why boeing makes it , is to squeeze more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared with our development , ” said kevin кенистон__keniston , airbus head of passenger comfort in europe .
on the other hand , analysts say the parlors with full 10-местными__10-mestnymi rows for existing 777-х__777-kh indicate that many passengers prefer dense be made on seating arrangements , which can go hand in hand with lower fares .
“ seat width of 18 inches would be ideal for passengers , but the reality is that from a commercial point of view offer airbus due to the threat from 777-й__777-y model , ” said specialist interior salon mary kirby , founder and editor of runway girl network .
airbus and boeing does not provide chairs , but offer the catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select .
exploring the world of the jets even with blocking a roulette to check the competing plans .
praising the comfort , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense layout salon for budget airlines and regional flights .
airbus offers the a350 with 10-местными__10-mestnymi rows , but says she still does not sell it .
until recently , the airbus highlighted the need for additional modifications salons offering broader aisle seats on some of its planes .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft , as the experts say , it is unlikely to appeal to the new industry standard “ will soar , ” but it might distract attention from the wave of sales models of 777x .

“ this is two influential person ( and ) guebuza дхлакама__dkhlakama struggling against , ” said joseph ханлон__khanlon lecturer , open university and an expert on mozambique .

scientists shed light on how the tail of dog related to her mood .
earlier research has shown that happy dogs виляют__vilyayut tail in the right side ( from the point of view of a dog ) , while dogs alarmed помахивают__pomakhivayut tail mainly in the left side .
but now , scientists say that other members of the family dog may notice these subtle differences in вилянии__vilyanii tail and react to them .
professor giorgio валлортигара__vallortigara , нейробиолог__neyrobiolog from трентского__trentskogo university , says : “ it is well known that people have left and right side of the brain differently are involved in shaping the stimulators , which are positive or negative emotions . ”
here we have tried to look at this and many other species .
he added that just like humans , dogs have the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body , and vice versa , and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions .
to learn more about how dogs react to various повиливания__povilivaniya tails of other dogs , the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs .
they measured the frequency of heartbeat animals and analyzed their behavior .
perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction , and sometimes — in another
professor валлортигара__vallortigara said : “ we showed videos of dogs with dogs — either натуралистические__naturalisticheskie version or silhouette , to get rid of any of the other distorting factors , and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct more tail left or right . ”
when the animals have seen that nothing in the rest of the tail expressing the dog moved to the right ( from the point of view of виляющей__vilyayushchey tail dogs ) , they were totally relaxed .
but when they noticed that the tail was left mainly ( again from the point of view of виляющей__vilyayushchey tail dogs ) , their heartbeat учащалось__uchashchalos and they looked alarmed .
professor валлортигара__vallortigara said that he does not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other using these movements .
in fact , he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience , about what movements they should worry about , and what is not .
he says : “ if there are several meetings with other dogs and often виляние__vilyanie their tail to one side is associated with more friendly behavior , while the right side is less friendly behavior , then the dog reacts on the basis of that experience . ”
the researchers say that these results may give owners , vet and дрессировщикам__dressirovshchikam deeper understanding of emotions of the animal .
an expert in the field of behavior of dogs , john bradshaw , a visiting researcher in the school of veterinary бристольского__bristolskogo university , said it was not the first study to test whether a value for dogs left and right side .
last year a group of scientists from the university of lincoln found that dogs turn the head to the left , if they look at an aggressive dog , and right , if they look at довольную__dovolnuyu dog .
and in other scientific work at the university of victoria in canada , he reported : “ dogs often approached собаке-роботу__sobake-robotu when its tail виляние__vilyanie направлялось__napravlyalos left , not right , rather than become alarmed — the opposite of behavior towards the italian study . ”
he said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies are not entirely susceptible animals in films or собак-роботов__sobak-robotov as dogs .
it could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs , he explained .
“ while on various mammals there is enough evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes , many details are yet to be specified , and dogs are no exception , ” he said .
however , given the ease with which it can be registered their behavior , perhaps , soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction , and sometimes — in another .

the last and most indicative — our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wants britain to change their course on contract and on relations with the eu , based on trade , not politics .
this result , which was among the enterprises of all sizes and largest бизнес-групп__biznes-grupp , shows that business insists on “ meaningful change ” that would bring powers back to britain .
the stakes are high — the changes in the treaty and more favorable conditions for the uk will provide 16-процентный__16-protsentnyy shift in voting for it to stay in the eu .
the prime minister should not be any doubt : this poll shows that british business supports his plan to revise the terms of british membership in the eu .

the best conditions for british business and will become increasingly necessary as the eurozone is on a path of closer economic and financial integration .
priority should be given to jobs and growth in the uk and , as shown by the results of our survey for business this means greater focus on trade and fundamental changes in the standards of brussels .

in siberia , should not be devoted vegan : тепличный__teplichnyy tomato 't replacing супчик__supchik
why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in siberia , выясняла__vyyasnyala correspondent for ria novosti .
people do not completely the products of animal origin should not live in siberia .
here they do not move the winter without loss for health , and no hothouse tomatoes do not compensate them , consider the interviewees on the eve of the day of vegan new siberian диетологи__dietologi and doctors .
drink butter литрами__litrami
strict vegetarianism when refuse to not only from meat and fish , but also from the milk , honey , eggs , it becomes a way of life .
but врачи-диетологи__vrachi-dietologi believe in novosibirsk in siberia and other cities to adhere to the same stringent standards in nutrition at least неполезно__nepolezno for health .
complete refusal of animal products harmful .
in animal proteins contain essential amino acids , which are very difficult to compensate for the plant .
you need to include in your diet even milk or eggs , " sure dietitian marina богай__bogay .
she cites as an example an indispensable fish contains omega-3 fatty acid .
most of them rich in vegetable oil is linseed .
to " потребить__potrebit it in the necessary quantities for a person , you should drink литрами__litrami ! ” says a nutritionist .
doctors are confident that residents of siberia need to pay special attention to the рациону__ratsionu in winter .
especially in this season of vegetarianism is questioned .
in terms of our realities imposed higher requirements for food .
to keep warm , you need the extra calories .
“ if people limit themselves to animal products , respectively , this calorie he недобирает__nedobiraet " , says expert .
with this agree врач-диетолог__vrach-dietolog olga późniak coat of arms .
she adds that imported fruits and vegetables is not a solution .
it is better to eat mostly foods , which is grown in the region of residence or where he was born .
the genetic code is configured to better digestion and for these products .
and during the winter , people are not totally ok , your puppy and hot супчика__supchika or even something посытнее__posytnee " - explains its position doctor .
according to her , that may have веганы__vegany , truly useful various grains , cereals , legumes , local vegetables , apples , remaining in the winter , frozen berries .
but this is clearly not enough for nutrition .
according to claudia врача-гастроэнтеролога__vracha-gastroenterologa арифулиной__arifulinoy , siberians have vitamins in organisms level sufficient only from mid august to mid september .
the full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh environmental conditions , when the temperature can change per day at 30 degrees and the snow lies in may , нецелесообразен__netselesoobrazen .
the body for life will need energy , and that , above all , fat , " medic concludes .
doctors say that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women .
children grow up , they need a construction material , including in the form of amino acids .
but by adhering to vegetarianism , we give them inferior .
pregnant also need high content of protein , vitamins and trace elements in the menu .
" веганки__veganki them недополучают__nedopoluchayut " - sure богай__bogay .
арифулина__arifulina says that an adult free to choose anything , play with the toys , which wants " .
he has already formed an organism , the skeleton and organs .
but the children still need to eat better .
if the parents are depriving him of trace elements and amino acids , choosing for him that he will be there , it is just a violation of the rights of the child .
" disadvantage those or other substances for the development of the brain , bones of tomorrow will not be , ” she says .
all interviewed специалисты-медики__spetsialisty-mediki agree about the low quality of the winter crop in greenhouses and imported fruit and vegetables .
what to bring and grown up in greenhouses , contains fewer required us to trace elements than ( grown up ) in the open ground .
" quality products then 't " says богай__bogay .
арифулина__arifulina also notes that imported and hothouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards .
sometimes the desire of the manufacturers to build larger crop damages the quality .
't " apples are brown on the cut , cucumbers and quickly желтеют__zhelteyut плесневеют__plesneveyut , tasteless tomatoes and неароматные__nearomatnye " " gives examples medic , adding that they likely напичканы__napichkany excessive amounts of fertilizers .
and suppliers are not vitamins , and fiber .
with this disagrees завлабораторией__zavlaboratoriey siberian physical-technical institute of agricultural issues , candidate of agricultural sciences vera petruk .
she says that with the right approach , and observance of all standards and requirements of the cultivation of vegetables in greenhouses may stand .
if they try to push more with a square meter , then , of course , and to become more often and plants перекармливать__perekarmlivat mineral fertilisers .
for example , when too much nitrogen fertilizers , tomatoes are growing quickly , but they are large , watery and несладкие__nesladkie " - she explains , adding that the issue of quality , in the first place , depends of conscience from the manufacturer .

as a result , it is proposed to build 't parking and rental store , not to expand , and reduce road a part ( in order to the streets became more friendly for pedestrians ) , as well as limit the use and placing personal transport within the conservation area of historic centre ( common ground around 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city ) .

you can vote for him or for any of the other top 10 cnn heroes , so he became a hero of the year .
this man receives $ 250,000 to continue his remarkable work .
for 21 years , georges бвелле__bvelle saw his father came back to life and again sink into unconsciousness , wandering across hospitals , which were not properly equipped to help him .
джамеф__dzhamef бвелле__bvelle was injured in a car crash in 1981 near yaoundé , the capital of cameroon .
at first he had only a broken hand but the contagion spread to the brain and caused гематому__gematomu , which resembled a about himself to the end of his life .
“ in cameroon had no neurosurgeons , ” said georges бвелле__bvelle .
if we had the money , we would have flown him from cameroon .
instead , бвелле__bvelle years accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals receiving any treatment that they could get .
“ it is not easy , ” said бвелле__bvelle .
— you can withdraw from the house at 5 a.m. to run back to the hospital to be first , but you are not the first .
patients very much .
some may die because they have to wait .
the situation is not much changed since the father бвелле__bvelle died in 2002 .
according to the world health organization , in cameroon , only one doctor for 5,000 people .
by comparison , the ratio in the united states — one doctor at 413 people .
and even if камерунцы__kameruntsy could have gone to a doctor , many of them it could not afford .
two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line , and nearly three quarters of health expenditures in it are private .
“ their only problem is poverty , ” said бвелле__bvelle .
— and because of the poverty they cannot enjoy their lives . ”
seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots , бвелле__bvelle became determined to do something with this .
last year , dr georges бвелле__bvelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations .
he became a doctor and has vascular surgeon at the central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded the non-profit organization ascovime , which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his band of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people .
almost every friday , he and another 30 people набиваются__nabivayutsya in vans , which chain to roofs medical supplies and travel over rough terrain to visit villages need help .
not always brings them luck .
more than once they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud .
but when they arrive , they are welcomed as the true heroes : this holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms which can only suggest local residents .
free medical care in these villages really is a cause for celebration , and бвелле__bvelle with his broad smile and infinite energy is more than happy to join in the fun .
the next morning the team starts to take hundreds of patients .
“ we have 500 people on each trip , ” said бвелле__bvelle .
they come from the whole vicinity within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village , and they come on foot .
each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services .
many people get treatment for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , disease , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
others may receive donated crutches points or free birth certificates - documents needed for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the brigade has a simple operation under a local anesthesia .
surgery is usually held in the building of the school , municipality or in the house ; after the procedure , patients come and go in послеоперационную__posleoperatsionnuyu area to make space for the next person .
using a generator to provide lighting operating and sanitization equipment бвелле__bvelle and its volunteers work until the early hours of sunday .
this determination непосильный__neposilnyy pace , but teams usually help to keep rural musicians .
“ they all night beat the drums , so we were awake and continued to work , ” said бвелле__bvelle .
on sunday , the brigade members sent back to town , tired , but proud of his work .
this group , consisting of камерунских__kamerunskikh foreign doctors and medical students , has 700 free operations last year , and they know that their aid could be of great value for those they help .
one man explained that they obtained free surgery for the hernia treatment will allow him to work again .
“ this will change the future for me and my family , ” the man said .
in addition to these clinical methods in the weekend and work in a hospital surgeon бвелле__bvelle also works nights in a private medical clinics around the yaoundé .
it is this second work , he said , provides 60 % of his funding a nonprofit organization ; the rest are covered by private donations .
“ i don ’ t even know when he sleeps , ” said cathy o 'мэлли__'melli , a second year medical student дрексельского__drekselskogo university in philadelphia , the volunteer group in бвелле__bvelle .
he has always either in the hospital or trying to earn money for the organization to continue with these campaigns .
for future doctors and nurses , such as about 'мэлли__'melli coming from the united states and europe to join бвелле__bvelle in implementing its objectives , it is an opportunity to practice , which they would never have got at home .
“ we have got to ассистировать__assistirovat on operations , where we helped remove the stains of blood or keep the tools for doctors бвелле__bvelle » , — said about 'мэлли__'melli .
being студентом-второкурсником__studentom-vtorokursnikom , you would never get this kind of opportunity in america .
студенты-волонтеры__studenty-volontery usually pay for their own travel to cameroon , often arriving with пожертвованными__pozhertvovannymi medicines .
but on arrival in yaounde them meals , transport and education pays бвелле__bvelle .
“ he is a hero , without a doubt , ” said about 'мэлли__'melli .
he gives his life to this organisation , and his desire to help the people of cameroon indefinitely .
for бвелле__bvelle almost constant work load is not an ordeal .
helping others to live a happy life , to fulfil this promise to his father — that is what brings him great joy .
“ i am so happy when i do this job , ” said бвелле__bvelle .
“ and i think about my father .
i hope he sees that i do .
i do it to make people laugh , to reduce their pain .
go to the site and see ascovime than you can help .

goldman sachs warned about the risks for the russian economy
goldman sachs warned of growing risks to the fragile driver of economic growth in russia , consumption .
this is primarily a crisis of arrears on unsecured consumer loans and mass layoffs of workers .
our main concern now is not that growth slowed , but rather , the structure of this growth .
lately , he is almost entirely due to consumption , which does not ease turnovers " , said goldman sachs chief economist for russia , representing clemens column yesterday quarterly report anywhere on the russian economy .
now the nominal wage growth in russia is about 10 % .
with inflation at 6 percent , he will be able to meet future consumer demand roughly at the current level , expect at goldman sachs .
but the profitability of russian companies is falling , however , most likely , they will improve the expenditure on staff .
today , we see a significant increase in the share of wages in gdp : if wages are rising by 10 per cent , while gdp is only 2 % , explained mr. column .
the company experienced a decline in profitability .
if it does not rise , it can lead to lay-offs and rise in unemployment .
not to raise the salaries of russian businesses cannot , said barclays capital chief economist for russia and cis vladimir пантюшин__pantyushin .
unemployment near historical lows , competition for workers is high .
to lure away from employees or keep the current employers to raise wages .
consumption in russia поддер__podder ­ живается__zhivaetsya and very rapid growth потребкредитования__potrebkreditovaniya .
according to mr. fields , because of the extremely high rates on consumer loans мультипликативного__multiplikativnogo effect on the economy of the country , this kind of lending does not .
the benefit to the economy from growing потребкредитования__potrebkreditovaniya we saw no , the money does not go to the economy , and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments , said economist .
but the problem in another - at goldman sachs expect growth of delay on unsecured credit .
they are mostly not rich who have nothing to offer as security .
interest rates on such loans are high .
as a result , they often do not return , ” said mr. column .
however the second threat to economic growth in russia - a possible crisis of arrears on unsecured credit .
the director of the hse institute banking vasily солодков__solodkov now sees signs of growing banking crisis .
'petit credit organizations without access to cheap resources , which have госбанков__gosbankov , were forced to raise funds for the population with high interest .
in response , госбанки__gosbanki went on the war-path and began to lower lending rates , says economist .
'petit credit organizations cannot give loans under the same interest , otherwise they will have negative interest margin .
if not abandon госбанки__gosbanki dumping , russia is in a full-fledged banking crisis , believes vasily солодков__solodkov .
revocation of the licences of several banks in recent weeks , the economist believes it a harbinger of collapse .
" themselves госбанки__gosbanki 't cope with such a situation : a system of deposit insurance was not originally designed for a systemic crisis , " warns head of the institute .
but consumption growth will slow and without the crisis of non-payments , believe in the prestigious - because of the refusal of indexing salaries for civil servants and the military , which in the current version of the draft budget .
partially hit consumption will be softened by the freeze tariffs of natural monopolies ( and , as a result , reduced inflation ) .
but only partly : if investments do not rise ( and the prerequisites for this are not yet - see the certificate ) , consumption growth still slows , confident of goldman sachs .
vladimir пантюшин__pantyushin from barclays capital until he sees the prerequisites for implementation of the pessimistic scenarios .
“ the main risk is still falling oil prices , he says .
in his estimation , the russian economy will shrink when the cost of oil below $ 90 per barrel .
at goldman sachs also noted that while the central bank cannot cut interest rates in the economy .
there is a paradoxical picture : inflation fell , and banks have been raising rates .
this may mean that they did not believe the central bank , объявившему__obyavivshemu transition to таргетированию__targetirovaniyu inflation " , said clemens column .
the policy of the central bank on market rates , affects not only affects the interbank lending rates .
" hopes for central bank it all collapse , " praised the clemens box .
the money received by the central bank auctions , banks are not lending to the economy , and to manage its liquidity
as soon as the reduced rate , just changing the exchange rate , it means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the rouble .
“ sooner or later , the central bank will understand that this strategy is not working , ” said mr. column and reminded that let the rouble float in " " state plans by the end of 2015 .
but will either have to do this before , or pick up a key central bank rate ( 5.5 % ) , he says .
in his estimation , the ruble is artificially overvalued by 10 % .
ruble only one road is weakening , - the expert concludes .
but if the central bank заронит__zaronit in финансистах__finansistakh even the shadow of a doubt that the currency is not part of the policy to weaken the currency , it can bring down the ruble is much stronger .

faa : “ air passengers can now use the gadgets on planes ( but not to call from your mobile phone ) ”
авиапассажиры__aviapassazhiry will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music , but not talking on mobile phones , according to long-awaited new guidelines , published on thursday , the federal aviation administration .
but passengers should not expect change to occur immediately .
how quickly such a change is implemented , will vary depending on the airline , said faa administrator michael huerta at a press conference .
faa to airlines will have to show how their planes meet the new guidelines and that they update their training manuals for members of the flight crew and the rules on the installation of devices to conform to the new guidelines .
faa said it has already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .
delta and jetblue were among airlines , which have already submitted plans .
“ depending on the condition of the plan we could approve the increased use of electronic devices very soon , ” the faa stated .
passengers are currently required to turn off their smartphones , tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes .
they should not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain will not give “ welcome . ”
passengers should turn off their devices once again when the plane is going down for planting , and not to include them , while the plane is on the ground .
in accordance with the new guidelines , airlines , whose planes properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff , landing and руления__ruleniya , faa said .
most new airliners and other planes modified so that passengers could use wi-fi at high altitudes , is expected to meet these criteria .
laura глейдинг__gleyding , president of the association of professional flight attendants , welcomed the change .
“ after the new policy will be implemented safely ( and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this , it will be the win-win option , ” said глейдинг__gleyding .
we frankly are tired of feeling “ дежурными__dezhurnymi on school ” when it comes to this issue .
but the internet connection for web browsing , exchange of electronic letters , text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet , the agency reported .
passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones , tablets and other devices in airplane mode .
thus , still no “ words with friends ” — intellectual gaming , in which the actor alec baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011 , when there was a notable case : the actor was filmed with the airline american airlines flight for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the aircraft was at the gate .
but heavier devices , such as laptops , still need to be laid in the luggage storage office because they can injure someone if they were flying around the cabin .
calls from the mobile phone in flight are still banned .
regulatory powers on telephone calls to the federal communications commission , not the faa .
faa may remove a ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
last month mark розенкер__rozenker from the national council for transport safety , the national transport safety expert for cbs news , said that cell phones are still considered at risk .
“ cell phones — it really is an issue , not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices , but we know thanks to the fcc , that it could interfere with cell phone towers is when the plane is in the air , ” said розенкер__rozenker .
an faa advisory committee created to study this issue , recommended last month that the government allowed the more widespread use of personal electronic devices .
in recent years , the growing pressure on the faa with the aim of easing restrictions on their use .
critics , such as democrats senator from missouri claire маккаскил__makkaskil , argue that there is no legitimate reason for the prohibitions related to security .
the restrictions also becomes more difficult to secure , as the use of devices has become ubiquitous .
some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions off its devices .
the faa to restrict passenger use of electronic devices in 1966 , in response to reports of помехах__pomekhakh for navigation and communications equipment , when passengers began to wear a fm-радиоприемники__fm-radiopriemniki — high-tech gadgets of the time .
new airplanes are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they also developed and approved faa as resistant to electronic interference .
the airline offered passengers use wifi at cruising altitude already for several years .
the aircraft , a modified for wi-fi-систем__wi-fi-sistem also more resistant to interference .
the vast majority of ships adapted for wider use of electronic devices , according to the new guidelines , huerta said .
today ’ s electronic devices typically emit radio much lower power than previous generation devices .
the device for reading electronic books , for example , emit only minimal signals at перелистывании__perelistyvanii pages .
but signals are becoming more powerful when the device download or send data .
among those who pushed for easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices of passengers , was the company amazon.com.
in 2011 the company representatives have downloaded a airliner their devices for reading electronic books for kindle and flew him to check for problems , but never found them .
faa advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices presents any risk .
douglas kidd from the national association of passengers said he believes distractions from the real device , even if the risk is minimal .
other members of the committee said that there are only individual messages pilots , confirming that the devices might be creating interference for aviation systems , and most of these messages are very old .

the new vaccine антиникотиновая__antinikotinovaya may inhibit the process of smoking pleasure
scientists have developed антиникотиновую__antinikotinovuyu vaccine , which could deprive the pleasure of smoking cigarettes .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect mice against nicotine addiction for life .
further tests are needed before trials on humans , in that it will take a few years , but professor ronald crystal from уэйлл__ueyll cornell medical college in new york , said that the first results are encouraging .
“ we very much hope that this strategy of using vaccines can finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit , испробовав__isprobovav all methods available in the market today , but find their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it by using these modern means , ” said professor cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of antibodies антиникотиновых__antinikotinovykh .
selectively virus infects liver cells , which then began to produce a steady stream of antibodies .
antibodies trace any nicotine molecules in the blood , нейтрализуя__neytralizuya them before they reach the brain , preventing getting a smoker никотинового__nikotinovogo strike .
in tests вакцинированные__vaktsinirovannye mouse , which later gave the nicotine , continued their normal activities .
and the mouse , which did not give the vaccine , ” “ relax our effort relying solely , and it is a sign that the nicotine reached out to them - the brain , researchers say .
these experiments described in the journal science translational medicine .
previous tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies .
in order to maintain a high level of antibodies , injections needed to do so often that they were expensive and непрактичными__nepraktichnymi .
but the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because she makes liver cells in the factories of antibodies .
professor crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe , it would give the children before they have a desire to try a cigarette , preventing никотиновую__nikotinovuyu dependence .
but it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit .
“ they will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine , and that can help them get rid of this habit , ” he said .
british scientists said the results were interesting , but cautioned that more research is needed .

frontier airlines will charge for hand luggage
frontier airlines plans to charge passengers up to $ 100 for what they bring hand luggage on board his flight .
frontier airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for hand luggage and $ 2 for coffee or газировку__gazirovku , though their announcement on wednesday has been that passengers can leave yourself the whole bank .
the new fee applies to hand luggage bags in the luggage , however отсеках__otsekakh small bags , placed under the seat remain free .
frontier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is payable in advance , and $ 100 if travellers will pay only once at the gate .
a spokeswoman for frontier kate 'мэлли__'melli said that the fee to $ 100 to get passengers to take care of the payment in advance .
“ we do not want to charge for it , ” she said .
airlines have begun to charge for the first and second bag , сдаваемую__sdavaemuyu in baggage in 2008 .
passengers trying to avoid these fees , wave so much , how many will be able , in your carry-on luggage помещаемую__pomeshchaemuyu in the top slots because of what these отсеках__otsekakh often do not have enough space .
fees is one of the ways to make passengers less carry on board .
about 'мэлли__'melli said that this new fee is not really for the sake of making money .
the fact of the matter is that most loyal clients frontier say they find a place in the upper storage отсеках__otsekakh becomes all the more difficult .
passengers who bought tickets on the airline website , do not have to pay .
this means that one passenger in the queue at the frontier flight might be able to carry a bag for free , while the next customer in the queue can pay $ 100 for the same bag .
about 'мэлли__'melli said that changes to procedures on the website and the check-in desk frontier is intended to ensure that the passengers will know about the collection before they get to the exit of the gate .
a new frontier for hand baggage fee will not apply until the summer , though the date has yet to be set .
passengers often complain of fees for baggage and other fees , but airline adore them .
they argue that the baggage handling costs money , and passengers who need this service should pay for it .
many on wall street believe the addition of baggage fees sign that airlines collect enough money to cover the costs of air travel after several years of losses .
but most of them are not related to the fees for hand luggage .
spirit airlines inc. has introduced the first hand baggage fee for three years ago and another discounter allegiant air later followed her example .
the only other airline with this collection is hungarian wizz air , said airlines consultant jay sorensen , who closely tracks the extra fees .
in his assessment of the report from december 2011 , the charge for hand luggage spirit brings in $ 50 million a year .
sorensen , a former midwest airlines senior manager , recently flew on flight spirit , and he was wondering what he would find at the gate , where the passengers will face an unusual collection of spirit for hand luggage .
“ the process of planting was the smooth of those that i have seen in my career in the airlines , ” he said .
i expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate .
the plane was full , he said , “ and the landing passed quickly . ”
frontier also follows the spirit in respect of fees at $ 2 for coffee , tea , газировку__gazirovku or juice .
frontier said that passengers who get газировку__gazirovku or juice , can leave a whole jar and that долив__doliv coffee will be provided free of charge .
it will still be handing out free water .
us airways short time trying to charge for drinks in 2008 , but abandoned this in seven months , after passengers began to complain , and no other major airline not followed her example .
on the initiative of the frontier взиманию__vzimaniyu fee for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline , it is the latest measure to attract customers to its web site .
airlines pay онлайн-продавцам__onlayn-prodavtsam tickets , such as orbitz , from $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
this gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them and not to contact the travel онлайн-агентство__onlayn-agentstvo .
but frontier all went further in this area .
in september , she started to give two times less often miles flying passenger customers who bought tickets through online travel agency .
on wednesday she cut премиальное__premialnoe number of miles up to 25 percent of the miles of travel .
so , the trip to 1,000 miles from the frontier , bought from online travel agency , would get 250 miles .
in addition , passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the website of the frontier .
the frontier is the base of loyal customers in her hometown of denver , but its business is shrinking and becoming loss .
revenue fell 9 percent , and flight opportunities fell by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter , according to financial results announced wednesday the parent company republic airways holdings inc .
republic is trying to rectify finance frontier in the sale of the airline .

parents can choose интерсексуальных__interseksualnykh children “ uncertain ” paul
germany became the first european country , which acknowledged the third floor in children born with external sex organs of intermediate type .
the newborn will no longer be necessary to attribute a male or female gender .
the new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children , allowing parents to set the floor as “ indefinite ” or “ unidentified ” in their birth certificates .
the purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents that can take quick decisions about surgery for assigned gender newborn , and counter discrimination интерсексуальных__interseksualnykh people .
one интерсексуальный__interseksualnyy people , according to the bbc , he said many years later : “ i am not a man and not a woman . ”
i stay by doctors patchwork of product with bruises and scars .
roughly one in two thousand children , background , every year is neither boy nor girl .
they have one of the intersex , approximately 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development ” — the collective term for people with атипичными__atipichnymi chromosomes , гонадами__gonadami ( яичниками__yaichnikami or семенниками__semennikami ) or unusually развившимися__razvivshimisya external sex organs .
wallis simpson may have been интерсексуалом__interseksualom .
gender identification is still not understood , but most experts in the united states say that when sex cannot be determined , it is better to use all available information and assign to it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation , if it happens at all .
new york psychiatrist , dr. jack drescher , who specializes in gender identification issues , said that the new german law “ sounds like a good idea . ”
интерсексуальные__interseksualnye children creates an ethical dilemma .
“ some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention , but the majority of children is not present them , ” he said .
you can assign to the floor without surgery and then see how personality develops .
the science of how the child will develop a gender identity , not too accurate .
no one can answer questions about why this is happening .
this is a mystery about why people are being homosexual .
the report sent to the european commission in 2011 , describes интерсексуальных__interseksualnykh people as distinct from transgender or transgender because their condition relates to 't гендеру__genderu , but to their biological structure which does not correspond to solely neither male nor female sex , and typical of both at once or not typical for any one of them .
these features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual symptoms such as muscle mass , hair distribution cover , chest and physique ; primary sexual signs , such as reproductive organs and genitalia , or in the structure of chromosomes and гормонах__gormonakh .
the report also gives a general idea about the discrimination faced by интерсексуальные__interseksualnye and transgender people in employment , as well as the level of harassment , violence and crime on the ground of prejudice .
the boys from gender variations now have a special camp .
australia and nepal has already allow adults to male , female or “ third gender ” in its official documents .
in june , a 52-year-old resident of australia норри__norri мэй-уэлби__mey-uelbi became the first person in the world , acknowledged “ бесполым__bespolym ” отстояв__otstoyav in court the right to maintain “ undetermined ” sexual status for life .
according to the ministry of internal affairs , the third german passports will be used in addition to mark m , f or x , i.e. интерсексуальный__interseksualnyy .
in neighboring france , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news release on the tv channel france 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of lawmakers from france , this a deeply catholic country , signed a petition to remove the “ gender theory ” from school textbooks .
american website catholic online also expressed disagreement with german law , writing that “ in a situation where the world is involved in a new state , where the floor is a matter of choice , and sexual activity — no , we still переворачиваем__perevorachivaem two pillars of civilization . ”
one mother of a newborn baby from the maryland site zone also announced that it would have to set the floor for children at birth .
“ it is difficult enough to raise a child , and without additional restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of their child , ” she said web site for parents .
children need stability and confidence .
historically , children born with male and female reproductive organs , named гермафродитами__germafroditami — named handsome greek god who had signs of both sexes .
and yet just ten years ago the medical community воспринимало__vosprinimalo gender as a sheet on which we can all erase and then draw again .
but now many are questioning the ethical justification for surgery , knowing that gender identity is complicated , and doctors sometimes makes the wrong choice , not knowing how the child will be assigned him to the floor , when will grow .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , this was called " " urgent psychiatric case , ” drescher said .
when these children were born , you rang 't psychiatrist — you rang the surgeon .
the dominant theory about how to treat children with гениталиями__genitaliyami intermediate type , was proposed by dr. john mani of johns hopkins university , who believed that gender easily amenable to change .
he introduced into circulation , the term “ gender identity ” and argued that the signals of the environment , including the social — that , as parents , the parents of the child — interact with genes and hormones child , determining whether a person is considered to be a male or female .
but in one case of 1966 , known as “ john / joan ” , his theories were called into question .
he advised the parents of the boy , whose penis was damaged during the circumcision , negligent child also entirely castrating , removing his testicles , and raise him as a little girl .
“ mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition , but this was not the case , ” said drescher .
when he was about 15 years old , he became a little boy again and married to a woman .
but in 38 years , he committed suicide .
drescher said that today , some doctors are still “ apply this model . ”
but in the 1990s , with the advent of the internet , people who survived the operation for a sex change , declared himself “ dissatisfied with the result . ”
such was the case , by jim bruce , a writer from the state of montana , who was born with male xy chromosomes , but гениталиями__genitaliyami intermediate type .
doctors could not accurately determine whether he has had a large clitoris , or a small penis , and were convinced that he will never be able to live “ a life of men . ”
however shortly after his birth in 1976 external sexual organ and testicles bruce were surgically removed , and he was raised as a girl .
he began to give female hormones at the age of 12 years .
“ i knew that i was not a girl , ” he told abcnews.com.
i was unhappy , but it was very difficult to ask questions .
in the 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty .
but being in the depression and understanding that something is wrong , he asked for medical records .
what he learned , it was terrible .
i was sterilized at birth , and no one ever told me about this .
bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development , which has kept his body to produce enough testosterone to normal development of genital mutilation .
after learning the truth , he again became a man , taking testosterone injections and removing their breasts .
the procedure made him sterile .
today , he performs in the defense of others in the organization called interface project , trying to bring in the normal perception of people with интерсексуальностью__interseksualnostyu .
but ann тэмар-мэттис__temar-mettis , executive director of the california association for legal advocates is informed choice , is concerned that the german law “ urges навешиванию__naveshivaniyu labeling and stigma . ”
“ many activists are concerned that the german law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and give the child an uncertain " " floor , ” she said .
we are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention .
we believe that it is better to assign male or female gender , then to wait .
but we have not seen this law would behave , so all that we can do is to make suppositions .
тэмар-мэттис__temar-mettis said her organization supports the australian law , because “ it allows adults to make choice in favor of the third floor . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about the formal sex , ” she says .
german law implies its assigned at birth .
it is a battle in which the small children should not enter at this stage .
when they grow up , then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies .
but dr арлин__arlin baratz , маммолог-рентгенолог__mammolog-rentgenolog from pittsburgh , which has a daughter with violation of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group , said that german law “ support ” as parents , as well as children .
baratz daughter , katie , was born with male chromosomes , but it has its violation of the sexual development called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome . ”
because its андрогенные__androgennye receptors work incorrectly , katie have developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but no uterus and ovaries .
now , at 29 , katie is married and studies in pediatric psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania .
despite the fact that it barren , it hopes to become a parent via adoption or having gestational surrogate motherhood .
“ the law gives parents the time to not take any hasty decisions themselves , ” baratz said .
he gives them time to do any analysis or understand the situation , as well as the period of time before they write “ male ” and “ female . ”
in this case you in order — растите__rastite baby love child .
you have a lovely child , and you feel joy .
we do not need to do the operation quickly , which is irreversible .
“ it allows children to participate in solving and eliminates the excitement that is driven by parents , because they do not feel that doing the right thing , ” she said .
in the end the child decides what flooring him or her more comfortable — and that ’ s fine .
this gives children the opportunity to decide on their own .

the court suspended the execution of the judgment on the practice of “ остановить-и-обыскать__ostanovit-i-obyskat ” in the new york police department
on thursday , the court of appeal federal district has suspended enforcement of a court order demanding changes in the program “ остановить-и-обыскать__ostanovit-i-obyskat ” of the new york police department , and the judge dismissed the case .
united states court of appeals for the second circuit said that judge sheindlin ширы__shiry execution of decisions will be suspended pending the results of an appeal lodged on the city .
in august , a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how he carried out the program for street detention and questioning .
the city appealed the decision and the resolution on corrective measures , including a requirement to appoint the controller to help the police to change work practices and related training program .
on thursday , the court of appeal heard oral hearing on the request to suspend the case .
the court of appeal has said about the need to remove judges because it violated the code of conduct for united states judges and 't посчиталась__poschitalas with the need to avoid demonstrations of bias , in part because of a series of interviews to the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court .
the judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people unnecessarily turning to black and hispanic on the program “ остановить-и-обыскать__ostanovit-i-obyskat . ”
it has appointed external controller to oversee the far-reaching changes , which include reforms to the policies , training , and monitoring , and also agreed to launch a pilot program for testing закрепляемых__zakreplyaemykh on body cameras in the police stations , where there is a majority of detentions .
in august , new york came to the decision to cease the practice of storing the names and addresses of people , cases in which were stopped after a police investigation .
debate on appeal of the city should be held after march 14 , 2014 .
“ the tactic of stopping and searching ” was criticised for many lawyers in civil rights .
“ остановка-обыск__ostanovka-obysk ” practiced for decades in one form or another , but the number of documented stops increased dramatically under the administration of an independent mayor michael bloomberg ’ s , reaching in 2011 in an absolute maximum 684 330 people , most of them black and hispanic .
in 2004 , four people , all — representatives of national minorities , have filed a class action in court .
supporters of the changes in the program “ остановить-и-обыскать__ostanovit-i-obyskat ” in the new york police department say that these changes will end unfair practice , provide a more reliable and effective police service , and could affect how other departments of police carrying out the practice .
opponents argue that the change undermines the morale of the police , not the crime rate , would lead to unnecessary expenditure of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to the reduced number of officers at several thousand over the last decade .
the judge noted that it did not stop the practice of “ остановить-и-обыскать__ostanovit-i-obyskat ” which complies with the constitution , but changes the way new york police stops of people .

there is also money for hospitals that accept patients without reservation , in hobart and лонсестоне__lonsestone , to improve the quality of care after in-patient , training medical professionals , mental health services and implementation of systems of personal electronic health cards in local hospitals .
“ this investment will go on advanced doctors made the implementation of ideas about how best to help tasmania health system , ” said ms. плиберсек__plibersek .
the minister insisted that the government of tasmania will operate in the mode of strict accountability and responsibility .
the state will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive cash of the commonwealth , and monthly report about where he spends these additional funds .
the commission will be created from three people to make sure the state provides services as can be more efficient and more effective .
mr wilkie said today that $ 325 million will solve nothing , if not “ behind them will be followed by genuine reform , which would put the health care system tasmania on a more sustainable basis . ”
nevertheless , he praised the government for a response to his request for urgent assistance , with which he first turned to the prime minister in early may .
“ i hope that the package of federal aid will significantly contribute to the conclusion of the health care system of this state from critical condition , ” said mr wilkie .
according to the state government , these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for recent cuts .
but the federal opposition spokesman on health , peter даттон__datton believes that today ’ s statement represents “ a solution similar лейкопластырю__leykoplastyryu . ”
“ the reason we are here is that the state labor government вырвало__vyrvalo $ 430 million of health system , ” he told the television network abc tv .
when the government of the state of lifting nearly half a billion dollars , and the commonwealth invests 300 million , you cannot pretend that this is good news .
mr даттон__datton asked ms. плиберсек__plibersek guarantee that no one dollar from the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy .

the cry of despair obama voter
i voted for president obama twice , sharing hope in possibility of change
he says obama allowed обструкционизму__obstruktsionizmu republicans overshadow the laudable efforts .
obstructionism cannot serve as justification for the problems with the website реформируемой__reformiruemoy obama health care system , drone attacks
memoirs of the obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been
nathaniel morris p . - the second year student of medical faculty of harvard university .
i read a terribly sad book these days .
i thought that this book will inspire me in times of gloom in the second year of medical faculty and restore in me a sense of hope .
it is called “ the impudence to win ” , and this memoir about the presidential campaign of barack obama in 2008 .
when i finish my evening to write reports on patients and go to bed , this book brings me back to the time when the policy inspired millions of people , and performances could capture the spirit .
victory in the elections was formidable , and leading news programs did pause for reflection of this historical moment .
my classmates crying with joy , and my parents who guarded all newspapers , which only they could find .
the white house had come to a young team of strategists and the nation was ready for change .
while obama into office in 2008 , his level of support was 82 % .
then i close the book .
return to the present is a rude awakening , as выдергивание__vydergivanie from dreams .
it is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory , a sad reminder of lost opportunities .
during the years that have passed since i dropped his first ballot , the changes actually occurred .
it was that i could not even imagine .
i give obama credit for its large and diverse achievements , from the adoption of the law on available medical care to the withdrawal of our troops from iraq , the cancellation of the rules of “ don ’ t ask , not tell ” , the killing of osama bin laden .
moreover , i believe that the party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward : immigration reform , choice of public health and the closure of the base in guantanamo , among others .
but after innumerable number of times , when i was on the side of the obama administration defending it in front of colleagues and peers , i have ended explanation , which i can provide .
i have reached the point of political desperation .
republican obstructionism could not explain the permission to прослушку__proslushku foreign leaders or drawing беспилотниками__bespilotnikami strikes on innocent children in other countries .
he could not explain to collect data about the private lives of americans , the national security agency or persecution , разоблачителей__razoblachiteley outlines government misconduct .
he could not explain the murder of u.s. citizen anwar al-aulaqi without trial or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during the presidential campaign .
he cannot justify the findings of the report , which states that the прикладываемые__prikladyvaemye white house efforts to silence the media , are “ the most aggressive ... since the nixon administration . ”
and lately he cannot justify the fact that you cannot develop a simple web site for more than three years after signing the affordable care act .
i do not know that i should have been expected .
should i was at the age of 18 years to understand that leadership may contradict the political campaigns that precede him ?
it is obvious that work on an elective office is not predictable programme of action , because our public dialogue will form the opposition political party and random events such as the carnage in newtown .
yet for all the listed me above examples shows that they were largely his own choice of the administration .
and that is what bothers me the most .
i voted for obama again in 2012 , but not because i was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
mitt romney was a strange and crass alternative , it seemed that he was not in a position to make a decision on their own policies or views .
i thought that in his second term obama , freed from the pressure of future elections meets hope , about which we have heard for so long .
however , when this week , obama ’ s approval rating fell below 45 percent , to return to 2008 through this book has become much more difficult .
it makes me pine for many promises which улетучились__uletuchilis .
this week i read that part of the book , which describes how obama , clinton was deafening , defeated in the primary election in pennsylvania .
at the meeting on the analysis of the reasons of failures , he told his staff that they should go back to normal and remain faithful to its purpose .
“ i want us to have returned to our appeal , ” he said .
“ we must remember who we are . ”
five years have passed , mr president , and i agree with you entirely .
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely натаниэлю__natanielyu моррису__morrisu .

in egypt , is sworn in as the first freely elected president
mohamed morsi takes the oath of office , but his day celebrations is unlikely to be the end of a знаменовать__znamenovat political struggle in egypt .
islamist mohammed morsi promised a “ new egypt ” when making oath , becoming the first freely elected president of the country , having replaced hosni mubarak , who was overthrown 16 months ago .
at his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court , morsi also became the first freely elected islamist president in the arab world and the fifth head of state in egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he took the oath before 18 judges in black мантиях__mantiyakh in court on the banks of the nile , built in the style of an ancient egyptian temple .
“ we strive for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” morsi said during a ceremony shown live on state television .
“ today , the egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life — absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , ” said morsi , 60th engineer with american education from the muslim brotherhood , the fundamentalist group from which most of the 84 years of its existence was a banned organization , служившей__sluzhivshey target for tough action by successive governments .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as morsi arrived with a small кортежем__kortezhem shortly after 11 a.m. local time .
only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to greet the new president , and , unlike the presidential fanfare since mubarak , the movement was stopped only for a short period of time to miss his convoy on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs .
although morsi ridiculed as “ нехаризматичное__nekharizmatichnoe spare wheel ” “ brothers ” , his personal prestige has soared since his victory and friday 's speech , in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only islamists , but also all those who want to bring the matter before the end of the 2011 uprising against mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule .
“ egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , ” morsi said , dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie , judges in обшитом__obshitom wooden panels hall where he took the oath of office .
later , morsi went to cairo university , where he had to pronounce its инаугурационную__inauguratsionnuyu speech .
he was be provided the official reception with army orchestra исполнившим__ispolnivshim national anthem during which he stood by the “ quiet . ”
field marshal hussein tantawi , attended military figure .
his arrival was greeted with the slogan “ the army and the people are one hand , ” who chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university .
founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , cairo university in the 1970s , became a stronghold of islamist student groups .
morsi took a symbolic oath on friday in tahrir square , where the uprising began , завершившее__zavershivshee mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule last year , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers , which his office was deprived of the military council that has made the case against the deposed leader .
but by agreeing to take the oath before the court , rather than before parliament as is customary , he performs the will of the military , and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue .
morsi ’ s speech in tahrir square was filled with theatres with populist gestures .

for comparison — the australian schools give an average of 143 hours per year , and in singapore , pupils are engaged about 138 hours .
although the formal requirements to spend more time in the schedule will not mathematics , sources in the coalition said that large-scale school final examinations in mathematics , in combination with an increased coefficient table ratings , will likely serve as an incentive to give schools extra training on this subject .
in the curriculums , more attention will be paid to the tasks of real life , ” including financial mathematics .

football is the reason for this hatred ?
in the state duma within " public platform " politicians and experts talking about how to save the world in russia .
among the proposals sounded and this ban : football in the north caucasus , because from this game - some scandals and discord .
speaker sergei naryshkin reminded about recent events in бирюлеве__biryuleve and said that to reduce " degrees of tension in society " politicians and the media should be careful and accurate in using utterances .
perhaps he had in mind a recent scandal with vladimir жириновским__zhirinovskim , who in one television threatened to encircle the caucasus barbed wire , if there does not want to limit birth rates ...
all the speakers talked about the measures on regulation of migration from the cis countries , and on measures to harmonize relations between peoples , russia ’ s , which made the discussions сумбурность__sumburnost .
maksim grigoryev said that events in бирюлеве__biryuleve " model a conflict that could predict " but " for these questions we have answers too many people and the courts , and the seven babysitters child without an eye .
the concept of multiculturalism , which for a long time in terms of migrants practised europe , according to общественника__obshchestvennika , failed , and we need to find their way .
historian yuri petrov pinned high hopes on a new unified history textbook .
" still need to create allowance on the history of culture of the people of the country to schoolchildren in tatarstan knew that for people living in dagestan , and vice versa , he said .
gennady zyuganov suggested to criminalize the " appeals to dismember russia " : " if in the united states , say on the radio , that it is necessary to give alaska to russia , you get arrested and given 20 years in prison ! ”
vladimir zhirinovsky , very hard to stir a 't " " .
as usual , all he accused journalists who get sick and acute national problems in public debate : " little in the heat of debate whether what you say ! ”

we have taken about 30 laws which regulate migration , and order in general is installed , said mr. vasiliev .
as an example , he cited a law that imposes on regional and municipal authorities responsible for ethnic peace in their territory .
but ludmila андриченко__andrichenko delight about this law is not divided : there are no " clear ideas about what such an adaptation of migrants , about its mechanisms and limits .
it means that actors will interpret differently the volume of these powers .
in addition , municipalities have no personnel necessary to address such complex issues , no money , and methodical recommendations , which they could use the centre , they do not give ...
the head of the duma committee on nationalities гаджимет__gadzhimet сафаралиев__safaraliev offered to create a special office with formidable name " " ministry of national security , which would be engaged in issues of national policy .
but valery artem tishkov , who in the 1990s led a similar agency , subsequently упраздненное__uprazdnennoe , opposed .
it is enough to have on the federal level , special person " " minister without portfolio , to which one might ask , if that .
“ we walk on the edge , shells are near , very important representatives of different ethnic groups and religions together to act against provocations , and this work must get decent information support " , said church spokesman vsevolod chaplin for relations with society .
no state neutrality in relation to dangerous ideologies , including religious ones , to be , in his opinion , it should .
oleg 's нилов__nilov away debate in an unexpected direction : " more talented people than in chechnya or dagestan , still need to look , but not pushing them on the way , not on the road , ” he said .
" " not the road is the development of football : the footballer beat the crowd , the flags are burning , the fellows throw stones each other ...
we may not need such a football ?

the recognition of the national security agency reinforce the paranoia of corporations to state surveillance
warm day in late august , german police helicopter flew low over the u.s. consulate in frankfurt , germany ’ s financial capital .
according to the federal service for the protection of the constitution ( bfv ) , the german domestic intelligence service , its mission was to photograph the roof of the building , which is located less than 5 km from the european central bank and the bundesbank .
german media say the bfv had hoped to discover the intelligence listening devices , and these actions led to the talks between the us and the ministry of foreign affairs of germany in berlin .
james клэппер__klepper , director of national intelligence , in september , again assured that the united states will not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of u.s. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits . ”
but since edward snowden , a contract employee who became разоблачителем__razoblachitelem — began to publish your treasury intelligence secrets to the united states , european governments and executives no longer sure whether to trust the director on the word .
reports that the u.s. national security agency monitored the brazilian oil company petrobras and gained access to the data stored in the cloud service providers , including google and yahoo , have raised the paranoia of corporations , persecution by the state , to new heights .
the last straw was the news that the phone of chancellor angela merkel , perhaps , auditioned about ten years .
if the most influential person of europe can become a target , you are , of course , potential targets and business leaders .
snowden made an obvious intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the united states and companies .
i think it is quite likely that this data is used for mutual gain .
“ germany must wake up , ” said oliver grün , the president of the association of bitmi , which represents small and medium-sized it-company of germany .
german companies believe the us now poses almost the same risk as china , in the field of industrial espionage and data theft , according to a study published in july consulting agency ey .
in all the documents , uncovered by mr. сноуденом__snoudenom , nevertheless , has so far had no evidence that the united states passed the trade secrets of foreign companies in their own companies .
politicians expressed concern that the eu lacks a certain possibilities in the field of information technology and the internet , and expressed the opinion that he should try to reduce its dependence on the us .
businessmen are skeptical of that .
someone in the german parliament says that we must create a google .
i can only slowly close your eyes and open them again …
“ this is not an option , ” says гассо__gasso платтнер__plattner , president of the german company 's sap software for business .
if there is a need for a powerful european it industry , not have to allow her to die over 20 years ago .
all is subsidized in germany : from coal to cars and farmers .
all , apart from the it industry .
and yet the scope and the technical development of espionage agencies of the united states , which had become famous thanks to revelations сноудена__snoudena , were a shock for some companies who had previously thought that the greatest risk of exposure is china .
a big shift is happening in cloud technologies , where leaders of european companies better realized that data stored in the united states , are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to the study conducted by the cloud security alliance , about 10 percent of its non-american members abandoned plans to use facilities located in the united states , the cloud provider after revelations of u.s. data mining programme prism .
jim снейб__sneyb , one of the sap executive board , said : “ we are seeing that consumers are asking a new question , which has not occurred a year ago , namely : where are my data and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this jurisdiction . ”
many german leaders argue that the last message — this is just confirmation of what they already knew : powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets , and , consequently , these data should be protected at all costs .
what is economic espionage , is no surprise .
he always had a place .
“ this has been a subject of discussion for many years and not changed substantially in the current debate , ” says kurt bock , chief executive officer of chemical company basf .
americans шпионят__shpionyat for us on the commercial and industrial level , and we too шпионим__shpionim behind them , because it is in our national interests , protect our commercial ventures .
leaders of corporations typically do not like to boast of the retaliation they have taken , as this can provide an advantage to the enemy .
in large companies have long been усвоена__usvoena thought that take free usb drive at the exhibition or leave your laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least imprudently .
ulrich хакенберг__khakenberg , member of the board of directors of car company audi , says that for many years it is standard practice — collect mobile phones before board meetings , so they could not be used as подслушивающие__podslushivayushchie device .
the federal office for the protection of the constitution , germany recommends that managers of companies consider the use of simple pre-paid mobile phones during foreign trips because of the vulnerability of smartphones .
prepaid mobile phones subsequently blown .
nevertheless , there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to взломов__vzlomov and surveillance .
in germany , many such companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche .
“ small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience , staff and financial resources in order to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access , ” warns in the report of the bfv .
the united states warned their own companies about economic espionage from other countries .
the us national intelligence summary in february placed france along with israel and russia in the second series of offenders involved in хакерством__khakerstvom for economic intelligence , after china , says the washington post .
a member of the board of directors of the prestigious german company confirmed that when talking about economic espionage , the french are the worst of all . ”
bernard скарсини__skarsini , a former head of the french domestic intelligence agency , the dcri reportedly said in an interview this month : the services know perfectly well that all countries , even when they co-operate on counter-terrorism , шпионят__shpionyat for its allies . ”

the kenyan press indignant provocative media law
“ this is a terrible place , and there is reason to question : what can prevent the destruction by the parliament of the independence of the judicial system in the future ? ” — told the newspaper , calling the law unconstitutional .
“ this law is very severe and punitive , and we reject it , ” said cyrus mau , managing director of the capital group - the parent company capitalfm , which is one of the most respected in kenya independent radio stations and news site .
he said a new judicial authority on media “ will always be partisan , since it is a continuation of the government ” , and restrictions on the content and advertising would hurt kenya ’ s position in the global economy .
“ i hope the president will listen to us , and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the members of parliament , ” he said .
according to the newspaper the star , the new law essentially allows the government to “ take a stranglehold over the media , ” and the standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in kenya " received a serious blow ” and attacked the bill as “ ’ s draconian . ”
the adoption of the draft law is part of measures taken to enhance national security after the september attacks by muslim terrorists in the westgate shopping centre .

the agency rosbalt was stripped of the status of the media for foul language
31 october мосгорсуд__mosgorsud decided to void the license of the registration agency rosbalt , " writes " ribbon " .
the deprivation of status of media agency insisted roskomnadzor - for the systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media .
in the process , it has created an unpleasant precedent : the court considered it possible to close media that , in fact , in denying the right to nominate counter-arguments .
what is rosbalt
uab " " rosbalt news agency was established in st. petersburg in 2000 .
in subsequent years , the agency has opened a second head office in moscow and a number of regional offices .
the agency also has offices in the countries of the former soviet union .
since 2001 , rosbalt developed information-analytical and functioned as a federal agency .
by the mid 2000s , the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in russia .
at the same time , rosbalt has always held a rather specific niche : the nucleus of exclusive agency publications were ( and still are ) notes with reference to sources in the law enforcement agencies .
talk about the proximity of the security sectors continued throughout the existence of the agency .
along with what rosbalt had an extensive base of sources in various departments , in favor of such assumptions and implied that the project was led by natalia chaplin - the wife of viktor cherkesov .
in this leadership role in чаплиной__chaplinoy " росбалтом__rosbaltom " until the end is not clear : often it is called " " project leader .
the director general of the agency is larisa афонина__afonina , chief editor - nikolay ulyanov .
lately rosbalt 't featured in the ratings of federal media - neither on the quote , nor the audience .
in october , the agency took 25th place in the rating of russian media attendance sites according to liveinternet .
according to the data of the liveinternet , среднесуточная__srednesutochnaya audience rosbalt.ru site is about 150 thousand unique visitors ( and up to 500 thousand views ) , monthly - around three million unique visitors .
among the most popular materials over the past five months , notes about the helplessness of the kremlin in relations with ukraine , the death of the soloist " group king and jester " pogroms in the metropolitan бирюлеве__biryuleve .
the conflict " росбалта__rosbalta " with роскомнадзором__roskomnadzorom began in july 2013 , when entered into force amendments to the law on the mass media who banned journalists from foul language .
the office found the forbidden vocabulary in two published on the website of the agency arrived ( " dzhigit from krasnodar " and " pussy riot осквернили__oskvernili oil rigs " ) .
further hand describe differently .
on the basis of the roskomnadzor discovered video accused rosbalt on the gross and systematic violations of the law on mass media and turned to the courts to deprive the agency of the license .
in " росбалте__rosbalte " stated that claims departments неправомерны__nepravomerny : first , the videos were not редакционными__redaktsionnymi materials , secondly , foul words in them were masked , and thirdly , warnings immediately after the videos were removed from the site .
the agency appealed roscomnadzor court claims in the world - and when 22 october 2013 мосгорсуд__mosgorsud took action roscomnadzor , consideration of these complaints still continued .
but already the world number 25 , the judge ruled in favor of 't " росбалта__rosbalta " : chief editor nicholas ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offences and was fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video .
obviously , this is the outcome of the hearing and предрешило__predreshilo мосгорсуде__mosgorsude - if refuse from the idea that the outcome would be a foregone conclusion even earlier .
on october 31 , the court decided to admit the invalid certificate of registration " росбалта__rosbalta " , effectively blocking media agency status .
this is not to say that rosbalt during this confrontation remained alone .
the agency supported the state duma deputies ( a statement in the name of the head of roscomnadzor alexandra жарова__zharova signed on 10 october 26 deputies ; the document was filed on the initiative of the communist party ) .
about the closure of publications that claimed the head of the russian journalists union vsevolod bogdanov , president of the moscow journalists union pavel gusev and head of the presidential council on human rights , mikhail fedotov .
moreover , according to bogdanova , leadership roscomnadzor even gave him any guarantees that up to revocation of the license deal is not reached .
the trial of " росбалтом__rosbaltom " showed : under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be a means of mass media in russia today is the big question .

want to luminous in the dark ice cream ?
the british businessman has created a first in the world of glowing in the dark jellyfish ice cream using .
charlie francis used fluorescent properties of marine animal , to develop a light meal .
he came to this idea after reading an article about the scientific медузах__meduzakh , and convinced the scholars in china chemically to recreate the glowing protein .
ice cream reacts with the language of one who eats it , increasing the ph level in the white of the eye and causing it to glow .
chris says that since ice cream begins to glow when the mouth reacts to heat , it means that the more you лижете__lizhete , the more it becomes .
charlie , the founder of a company producing ice cream " лизни__lizni i tasty " , says : “ it is an incredible thing , but still at the initial stage , if we talk about production , so for £ 200 , you get about 2 grams of substance . ”
a protein that we use in мороженом__morozhenom , reacts with your tongue with a neutral ph .
however , when your mouth warm up the protein , it will raise the ph level and ice cream will start to glow .
we tested it in the last few months , and it seemed that the ideal would be to introduce him to halloween , because it creates such a luminous effect .
it is , perhaps , the most expensive ice creams from those that i did , because the jellyfish luminescence in four times more expensive than gold .
so every ball cost me about £ 140 .
but it is very pleasant to the taste .
pilot charlie company , based in bristol , is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and taste of mosaic gold .
but his next creation should be even more ambitious .
he said : “ i really want to develop invisible ice cream . ”
it is by definition impossible because of refractive errors caused by ice crystals , which is ice cream , but i think we will find a way to do it .
ice cream uses fluorescent properties of jellyfish , синтезированные__sintezirovannye chinese scholars

perhaps this will be the gas from the nord stream " " or reverse from slovakia .
the latter , according to officials , as is possible and acceptable manner in the event russia " isolates " ukraine .
analysts believe that such a way to reverse supplies to ukraine could be used only in a few weeks , and will likely lead to lower supplies in other regions .
" between eu countries and the ukrainians are held talks about how to create favourable conditions to ukraine could import gas from other sources , not from russia , or from the same source , but on other routes , " reuters source added .

syria destroyed equipment for химоружия__khimoruzhiya
syria destroyed all the declared facilities for production of chemical weapons , recognized by the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons .
this first stage of disarmament damascus finished the day before the deadline .
until 1 november syria was to destroy the manufacturing and other auxiliary objects intended for combat training in the use of toxic substances , reports the bbc .
the destruction of the stockpile of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by the middle of 2014 .
according to the representative of the opcw , currently toxic substances are in опечатанных__opechatannykh repositories .
international inspectors went to syria after on the outskirts of damascus on 21 august in the chemical attack were killed , according to the united states , more than 1,400 people .
the main task of the inspectors was not lose time to not allow syrian authorities to produce more химоружия__khimoruzhiya - and destroy infrastructure equipment for mixing chemicals and munitions .
behind these manufacturing facilities will now be watching carefully to prevent their repair .
the next milestone is the middle of november : by this time the opcw and syria must agree to a detailed plan of destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances .
a lot of questions here .
where will they be removed ?
who will provide the equipment for this ?
all syrian statements will be carefully checked by western разведслужбами__razvedsluzhbami .
they readily 'll inspectors new objects to test if there are grounds to suspect that damascus is not fully candid .
the united states believed that the shelling was held regular troops .
syria and russia insist that this was the work of the syrian rebels .
the world community has demanded from the syrian leadership is in accordance with the agreement reached by mediated by russia , is to destroy or lead in inoperable all capacity for the production of shells , toxic gases and liquids and shells for filling in these substances .
now , when this phase passed , the next step must be to destroy existing the syrian army химоружия__khimoruzhiya .
it is assumed that this could be arsenal more than 1,000 tons of toxic substances кожно-нарывного__kozhno-naryvnogo нервно-паралитических__nervno-paraliticheskikh , mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places .
for its destruction is necessary to the opcw and the syrian authorities for the agreed timetable of action - it is two weeks .
the head of the opcw field operations jerry smith told the bbc that his inspectors " personally watched the destruction of the equipment .
“ now they have no opportunity to conduct further production or mixing chemical weapons , ” he said .
in the statement , the opcw said its inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in syria and convinced us factories on manufacture of shells and toxic substances , either destroyed or are in order .
the remaining two objects too dangerous to carry out an inspection , the document says , but the equipment was carried out and inspected by specialists of the opcw .
according to smith , the process of destruction of infrastructure for the production was especially химоружия__khimoruzhiya " непрост__neprost " as work had in the ongoing conflict .
in early october , the opcw was awarded the nobel peace prize , however , according to smith , it is time to celebrate the inspectors have not yet been found - they were too busy with work .

george кереван__kerevan : the gap with europe gives шотландцам__shotlandtsam choice
another day , another страшилка__strashilka on independence .
this time , we warn that an independent scotland should join the european free movement area as a condition of eu membership .
it 's turn stories about passport control in бервике__bervike and the border with barbed wire along адрианова__adrianova shaft .
true , the newspaper strathclyde pointed to possible economic benefits from the more liberal movements in the rest of europe , though — predictably — not that it has appeared in headlines .
nobody 't also pointed out that the eu member states spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules as it is convenient .
because scotland is not included in the schengen area , the continued non-compliance with the requirements will become cheap concession to brussels in return for what he truly wanted from the scots .
so this is not the story one worthy of attention .
and so old that she has become a fossil : i first heard “ duck ” about what “ independence means passport control , ” at least 40 years ago .
and yet there is an interesting point , lost when пересказе__pereskaze ancient tales .
why does an independent scotland should comply with orders in europe ?
why change the yoke of london on the yoke of brussels , especially now ?
here is a real european news : the great post-war plan to unite europe finally stalled .
with еврокризисом__evrokrizisom project “ europe ” is officially dead .
across the european union the party opposed the eu or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency , gaining strength .
even in germany , “ euro-skeptics party alternative for germany , founded only this year — appeared from nowhere and won nearly five million votes in the september federal election , thus displacing essentially “ free democrats ” ( the equivalent of “ our ” ) liberal democrats , from the bundestag .
there was always the internal opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
nevertheless , the current economic crisis has become a turning point .
austerity imposed by berlin and the european central bank , and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of the common currency have led many people to believe that the project “ europe ” has gone too far .
the euro crisis is connected with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits — this was true only for greece .
in fact евросистема__evrosistema blocked its members on favorable exchange rates , for german exporters , is that german politicians and want to preserve .
without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency in southern europe is at a disadvantage in advance of production capacities in comparison with germany .
the only means of спасительное__spasitelnoe — to cut wages and government spending that actively supported by berlin .
for the current budget problems and exchange is a much deeper problem of the productive capacities of europe .
as a result of measures to “ green ” energy , embedded brussels subsidies — a cipher for french and german energy companies at the expense of consumers , european industry pays twice as much for electricity , and four times more for gas than in the united states .
this парализующе__paralizuyushche adverse price terms , as we have already seen in грейнджмуте__greyndzhmute .
no freezing wages in the world does not stop overwhelming victory of cheap shale gas in the united states over european petrochemical industry .
as a result of the rebellion is brewing , especially in france , once the most ярой__yaroy стороннице__storonnitse eu .
after the war , the french political elite saw the eu as a way to control germany and put paris on one level with washington .
but berlin no longer needed in paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy , and has already imposed its own economic policy of europe , leaving the destroyed the economy of france in distress .
the result — right , acting against the eu party marine le pen of the national front ” just won the decisive run-off election by discarding the ruling party of socialists into third place .
“ the front line ” is now the most popular party in france , with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning the british that it would not proceed from the assumption that the split among the right effect automatically in favor of the left .
what makes le pen with their newly inherited popularity among french white working class ?
she wants to use the elections to the eu in the next year to create a bloc in the european parliament against the eu and against the single currency .
if — and it is very likely — opposed to eu parties will receive support in this election , this unit will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the european parliament .
here is my opinion : soon the growing sentiment against the eu and against the single currency in europe will merge together to destroy the euro .
the eu will not go away , but he again becomes something of a “ vague europe ( sovereign ) nations , ” which like general de gaulle .
germany and several economies dependent on it can save the euro , but france and southern europe will restore its own currency .
i assume that britain distances himself from the project , hoping to get closer to the us .
nevertheless , the growing interest from washington to the pacific ocean indicates the likelihood that britain will be left without attention into the cold atlantic .
in what position it leaves scotland ?
we can choose to become a region ( essentially ) of england .
or we can to protect their own economic interests , which means , among other things , to send the berlin and brussels to hell in a handbasket .
i suspect that scotland can succeed in the freer european agreement provided that we will keep its currency .
cooperation with other странами-единомышленниками__stranami-edinomyshlennikami will be easier in europe нефедеральной__nefederalnoy nations .
otherwise , we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of norway and preserve our economic independence .
the government of the scottish national party in scotland is — ironically — the most successful political movement in europe , and against the austerity measures , which received a majority of the votes in 2011 due to objections against cuts proposed ( and sold ) labour chancellor exchequer aleister дарлингом__darlingom and subsequently raised by the coalition of tories and liberal democrats .
scotland would be ludicrous now to vote for independence , only to accept austerity imposed by berlin and brussels .

there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the mechanisms of early puberty
the trend toward early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist specializing in children ’ s health and family issues .
whether the mother пугаться__pugatsya if her daughter had begin to form the beginnings of the breast and pubic hair grow at 7 or 8 years ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics this week in orlando , florida , child эндокринолог__endokrinolog dr. paul капловитц__kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes is quite common among american girls and represent a new norm .
“ i spend a lot of time , calming parents — usually it does not mean the rapid advance of full sexual maturity , ” said капловитц__kaplovitts .
obvious signs of development , such as growing breasts and pubic hair axillaries are and smell the body appear earlier in girls .
but it was only a slight shift in the age of menarche ( first period ) over the last four decades .
in the united states , the average age of 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12,75 in 1970 .
“ after chest begins to develop , is at least two to three years before menarche » , — said капловитц__kaplovitts , who is also the author of “ early puberty in girls : how to cope with this widespread problem . ”
time is the most accurate check of how puberty will prosper .
there is debate about what constitutes an offensive sexual maturity , but is considered “ premature ” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp rise in growth to 8 years .
in most cases , the process will slow or be — is what the pediatrician can monitor carefully .
more rapid progress can serve as the basis for analyses have эндокринолога__endokrinologa to avoid serious problems , such as a tumor or cyst .
there are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence : premature aging of bones , which ultimately can lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood .
recommendations for drug or hormone therapy is based on the age of the child , the level of development , growth rates and emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
капловитц__kaplovitts cautious with drugs , but acknowledges that the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers . ”
another big problem is clear : parents simply do not want them to have very young daughters were menstruation .
“ they worry about the risks of pregnancy , or even about how they cope with hygiene issues , ” said капловитц__kaplovitts .
“ it was a shock , ” recalls one woman , the daughter of menstruation , which started in 10 years .
although there were signs and we talked about menstruation , she was not emotionally ready .
she came home from school , fearful and broken that it first among his friends .
there are many разрекламированных__razreklamirovannykh theories about the causes of early puberty .
nevertheless , there is no consistent evidence that to blame hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual statements in the media .
the boys — like girls , puberty begins earlier .
капловитц__kaplovitts argues that the premise , which has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity .
in 2001 , he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years , which connects the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty .
other data confirm this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
in this country and афроамериканские__afroamerikanskie latin american girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white сверстницы__sverstnitsy .
there are various explanations .
around the world , on early puberty , apparently affects everything from economic conditions and climate change to genes .
another mystery : although boys have hair on the face and on лобке__lobke appear at younger ages , a trend to complete it early sex not as pronounced as in girls .
other physicians participating in the conference of the aap , confirmed the complexity of this subject .
the emergence of pimples and pubic hair found even in infants and children of nursery age .
“ we must be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty , ” said dr. laurence silverman , child эндокринолог__endokrinolog at children ’ s hospital in гориеб__gorieb g . the morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from a pediatrician about how to talk with their child .
“ it may mean an earlier than expected , conversation , ” explained капловитц__kaplovitts .
if you keep calm , your child normally reacts well .
girls that blossom early , you need proof that even when it happens early , this process is a normal part of life .

he said that european leaders must be honest with his people in what spyware programs they have used for many years .
“ while we can change our tracking program to better protect the rights of europeans , they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only people involved in intelligence activities , ” murphy said .

the only thing i wait every halloween is trending .
the national retail federation predicts that the suits will be spent $ 1.2 billion from $ 6.9 billion .
this year , at the height of fashion sexual inanimate objects .
women no longer need to be members of the professions of sex ; they can also be sexual food such as pizza , гамбургерами__gamburgerami or морковками__morkovkami .
as for the men , i think we will see a lot of zombie thanks " ходячим__khodyachim мертвецам__mertvetsam ” , and i am confident that the astronauts in the style of the band daft punk tapes to be in our 11 this year .
according to google , the costumes , which are most often is a zombie , batman , pirates and witches .
perhaps , there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach .
we нарядили__naryadili our dogs last year and , to my surprise , we were not the only ones .
moreover , according to the national retail federation , americans spend this year , $ 330 million on costumes for pets .
this means a lot of funny собак-хотдогов__sobak-khotdogov .

the only thing that we do not want to use is in the form of candy corn grains ; and yet , according to the national confectioners association , nearly 35 million pounds of them sold for halloween .
this is about 9 billion individual corn зернышек__zernyshek .
this is the conundrum that i still have to solve .
nothing so expresses the essence of halloween as a haunted house .
they have terrific names , such as “ terror behind the walls ” ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , “ whine and cry ” and “ house of shock . ”
moreover , according to the society of america haunts , in america , there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses , generating about $ 500 million of income , as well as the stunning photos where you almost описалась__opisalas that your friend posted on facebook , and you cannot remove , and then the guy who you like , sees this picture and leave a comment like “ cool expression . ”
and in conclusion , let ’ s talk about the pumpkins .
charlie brown introduced us to the great тыквой__tykvoy when we were children , and cutting lamp jack — is like a christmas tree ornament , what we are doing with childhood .
fortunately for us , the fashion on the child in тыкве__tykve began only in the past year thanks to pinterest , so most of us grew up , these carved pumpkin , and not sitting in them .
according to the united states census bureau , this year americans spend about $ 106 million on the pumpkin .

the owners of pawn shops in singapore is doing well , while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
in lombard in shopping mall in singapore бендемир__bendemir джанани__dzhanani амиртхалинга__amirtkhalinga lays the golden bracelet , ring and earrings to pay for the education of his daughter .
“ my husband and i just bought a house so that all my money is invested there , ” said ms. амиртхалинга__amirtkhalinga .
though she earns s $ 3,000 ( $ 2,400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband also works , a monthly family income is not enough , she says .
indeed , demand in various parts of southeast asia — where the debt of households is growing — is that valuemax where she spends her deal this week became the third ломбардом__lombardom registered on the singapore stock exchange .
credit under pledge of jewellery is not just a quick way to get money ( s $ 1,300 in the case of ms. амиртхалинга__amirtkhalinga ) , but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
usually there are pawnbrokers in singapore in an effective annual interest rate of 17 % — slightly above the 15.4 % offered in the united overseas bank , a local lender , with a branch in the same shopping center .
however , pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or evidence of wage and can give loans faster than banks .
however , millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers , as households feel the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth , following the global financial crisis and cheap credit , подпитывавшихся__podpityvavshikhsya loose monetary policy in developed economies , low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers , to compensate for the decrease in revenues as the slowing growth of their economies .
this week , standard &amp; poor ’ s , the rating agency , 's indicated an increase in household leverage , mainly due to the growth of the mortgage , as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of asian banks .
it announced that malaysia , thailand and singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in asia .
malaysia topped the list with 80 % of gdp , compared with 60 % in 2008 .
economists also worry about high levels of consumer debt in thailand , which this week barely emerged from technical recession .
on thursday , data showed a continuing decline in exports and weakening consumer demand .
“ the bottom line is that people with higher prices in the middle and bottom of the income scale ] [ will look for ways to supplement their incomes where only able , ” says song сенг__seng вун__vun , economist at cimb , the malaysian bank .
record high gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the ibsc board with which people lay their personal belongings as they use to get money for their own family decorations .
in singapore , about 70 % of the things contained in paragraphs 200 ломбардных__lombardnykh city-state 's--are gold products .
people say : “ the price of gold looks good , let us заложим__zalozhim gold chain of grandmothers and get it back in the next month . ”
in thailand , the largest operator of pawn shops easymoney observed an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months , up to 20 % .
growth in business ломбардном__lombardnom is that valuemax , operator of the бендемире__bendemire and 15 other similar in singapore , plans to expand not only in neighboring malaysia , where it has four stores , but also outside of asia , too , says йеах__yeakh lee ching , executive director of valuemax .
the company will finance the expansion , with 60 per cent of s $ 66 million raised this week as a result of placement of shares on the singapore stock exchange .
while some lenders have sparked the fire of critics because of high interest rates , ms. lombard йеах__yeakh says that not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders , it also does not increase the debt directly .
“ clients lay items which they already possess , and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households , ” she says .
bet wins wider public recognition as a means to obtain short-term secured funding .
and while ломбардами__lombardami enjoyed not only those categories of people who are in a precarious financial position .
rich people in singapore also use of valuemax , laying gold ingots or a rolex , who can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash .
we are seeing clients from all sectors of society .
“ they include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short period of time for commercial projects or investments , or small businesses , which need to be overcome temporary financial difficulties , ” said ms. йеах__yeakh .
sometimes they simply needed money very quickly .

russian security officials had not known about the gang " fraternal circle " " novye izvestia
writes about this interfax.ru citing an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the russian federation .

in his opinion , the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called russian mafia , which allegedly operates abroad .
as previously mentioned neither " " yesterday , the us treasury has published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal gang " fraternal circle " .
among them was named and russian singer grigori leps .
it appears in the list as " grisha " , posted the day before .
with these popular russian singer they coincide .

you have a black box in your car ?
while american designers roads trying to find money to repair highways рассыпающейся__rassypayushcheysya system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box , neatly пристроенном__pristroennom on the dashboard of your car .
these devices , tracking every проезжаемую__proezzhaemuyu автомобилистом__avtomobilistom mile and transmit this information to officials , are at the center of the controversial attempts to modernize the antiquated system of financing the highways of america by routine by washington and the states .
usually a boring arena highways planning suddenly gave rise to intense debate and romantic alliances .
libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying the government for the right to use the small design to track the number of miles you проезжаемых__proezzhaemykh and even , perhaps , the one where you drive them - and then use this information when drawing up the tax bills .
tea party movement in shock .
the american civil liberties union also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life .
and although until congress can agree to continue or not , several states are not going to wait .
they ponder how over the next decade , you can go to the system , under which drivers pay for each mile road , which they can ride .
thousands of motorists had taken for testing these black boxes , some of which have a function of satellite tracking .
is it really necessary for our country .
“ this is not an issue on which we have may be the right choice , ” said hassan ихрата__ikhrata , executive director of the southern california association of governments , which trains plans to start tracking the state authorities miles проезжаемых__proezzhaemykh every californian автомобилистом__avtomobilistom , by 2025 .
there will be changes in how we pay these taxes .
the technology to do this already exists .
the need for this is aggravated by a lack of funds from the government fund the construction of highways , funded by taxes that americans pay on автозаправках__avtozapravkakh .
americans are not buying as much gasoline as before .
cars passing more miles on one gallon .
the federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon , not rose for 20 years .
politicians do not want to raise the tax by even one cent at high gasoline prices .
“ a tax on gasoline simply impossible to maintain , ” said li маннич__mannich , an expert on transport policy at the university of minnesota .
in his state was recently installed on the cars of 500 tracking devices for testing the system помильной__pomilnoy payment .
“ it would be the best option in the long run , ” he said .
call it the beggar помильной__pomilnoy user fee .
not surprisingly , this idea appeals to urban liberals , because with the help of taxes can be changed the nature of travel for reducing road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions , for example .
authorities planned in california could be waiting for this system in the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious targets set by the laws of this state to combat global warming .
however , a republican member of the house of representatives bill shuster ( pa . ) , chairman of the house transportation committee , said that he , too , sees the system as the most viable long-term alternatives .
advocates of the free market to fund “ reason ” also delighted from what drivers would pay for each mile .
“ it is not just a tax which will go into a black hole , ” said adrian moore , vice president of political affairs of reason .
people directly pay for what they receive .
this movement also is supported by two former ministers of transport of the united states , which in 2011 urged congress to move in the direction of помильной__pomilnoy payment .
the us senate approved last year in a pilot project at a cost of 90 million dollars , which would have involved about 10,000 vehicles .
but leaders of the house of representatives rejected this proposal due to fears of rural legislators representing voters who in everyday life have often come many miles to get to work or to the city .
a few states and cities , nevertheless , go on that path independently .
the greatest enthusiasm проявляется__proyavlyaetsya in oregon , where for participation in the largest experiment in the country get 5,000 drivers .
these drivers will soon be paying staff for miles driven instead of the tax on gasoline .
in nevada , a pilot project has been completed .
in new york , he is seen .
illinois опробует__oprobuet it on a limited basis involving lorries .
and the i-95 coalition , which includes departments of transport 17 states of the east coast ( including maryland , пенсильванию__pensilvaniyu , вирджинию__virdzhiniyu and florida ) , studying how they can spend these changes .
this concept has not received universal acceptance .
in nevada , where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices , drivers were concerned that the government can track their every step .
“ concerns about the “ big brother ” and such things is a big problem , ” said алауддин__alauddin khan , head of the issues of strategy and management efficiency at the department for transport , the state of nevada .
it was not what people wanted .
when the tests were underway , a branch of the american civil liberties union in nevada warned on its website : “ will be very easy to convert these devices in full tracking devices . ”
there is no need to create a huge , huge technological infrastructure , which will inevitably be extended for the storage of records about the everyday movements of individual citizens .
nevada is one of several states where we are soul searching low-cost technology that would allow authorities to keep state accounting проезжаемых__proezzhaemykh car miles , but no information about the place and time .
if you can do it , khan said , society will feel more calm .
the search for this technology led some state agencies to a small , young company in california called true mileage .
initially , this company has been attempting to collect state taxes .
she sought to enter the booming market of automobile insurance , in which drivers pay based on mileage .
but the device , which it began testing , attract designers roads because they do not use gps and provide a limited amount of information , periodically loaded with modem .
“ people will be more inclined to do it if you do not track their speed and does not track their location , ” said ryan morrison , executive director of the true mileage .
it was a few big mistakes in some of these pilot programs in the state .
there is much less expensive and less recurring ways to do it .
drivers in oregon designers are experimenting with provision of various options .
they can choose the device with or without gps .
or they could just abandon devices , deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that can ride all residents of the state .
in other places , they hope to sell the idea of настороженной__nastorozhennoy public , forcing the device to do more , not less .
the new york city transportation officials are seeking to develop налогооблагающее__nalogooblagayushchee device which will also take payment for parking lot meters , to provide “ pay as ездишь__ezdish " insurance pool and gather data about the speed in real time from other drivers , and that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams .
“ motorists will involve the benefits they offer , ” the document says urban design .
some designers transport systems , however , think about not whether all talk about paying a huge помильной__pomilnoy just a distraction .
in urban transport commission in the san francisco bay area officials say that congress could easily overcome bankruptcy trust fund the construction of highways , raising taxes on gasoline .
an additional lump sum or annual tax would charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline that they paid their fair share .
“ there is no need for radical surgical intervention , when all you need to do is take an aspirin , ” said randy рентшлер__rentshler , director of the commission on legislation and public relations .
if we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about his private life , and many other things .

announcing the news , vatican spokesman father federico lombardi said that before the ceremony will be held at san meeting all current cardinals , known as консистория__konsistoriya .
“ pope francis decided to inform us of its decision to convene консисторию__konsistoriyu in february in order to facilitate planning of other meetings with the participation of the cardinals from all over the world , ” said lombardi .
jack valero of the catholic voices , ” said that by february number кардиналов-выборщиков__kardinalov-vyborshchikov will likely fall .
he said that usually the pope calls cardinals as much as necessary to again bring the number of кардиналов-выборщиков__kardinalov-vyborshchikov to 120 , and so the cardinals over the age of 80 years as he chooses .
консистория__konsistoriya next year will have great significance because it will be the first since the election of francis , in march of this year , according to valero .
at the moment there is a kind of bias in favour of europe and especially in favor of italy .
“ it will be interesting to see whether the cardinals would appoint the new pope from other regions of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .
in south america , home to 40 percent of catholics , but they are insignificant number of cardinals .
it will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the council of cardinals francis — the group of eight cardinals from around the world , which is to seek ways of reforming the church .
in the past , the pope decided everything themselves .
“ now that francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him , ” said valero .
he said that “ it is entirely possible ” that francis will turn to кардиналам__kardinalam for advice .
but we have not been in this situation before that — all of it for us for the first time .
valero said the pope usually built in the position of cardinal bishops from large parishes , but francis “ full of surprises — however we do not know whom he names . ”

the tax for foreign property owners will lead to the fact that london bubble bursts
the treasury has carried out a preliminary evaluation measures for the tax on capital gains , but awaits a final decision from mr osborne , who in 2012 budget introduced the rate of state duty in the amount of 7 % for homes costing more than £ 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in partnership , not as individuals .
currently госпошлина__gosposhlina on residential real estate in parts of westminster , kensington and chelsea , rose from 708 million pounds in the 2012 / 13 financial year already exceeds the total amount for northern ireland , wales , scotland , the northeast , the northwest , йоркширу__yorkshiru and хамберу__khamberu taken together .
mr cook said : “ after the state duty for expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against evasion is very difficult to argue that taxation of expensive properties is undervalued regardless of the impact of the obsolete municipal tax system . ”
“ but this move may cause some foreign investors will be reluctant to buy properties in london or its current owners do not want to sell it , ” he added .
the cost of first-class real estate - the top 5 – 10 % of the housing market at a price — in the affluent south-west london belt , which stretches from фулхэма__fulkhema to wimbledon , increased by a record 11.8 % over the past year .

the next meeting of the association of mechanicians of the tyumen region was based on ялуторовского__yalutorovskogo automobile plant .
as part of the event , there was a presentation of the new line on the production line pipes of steel .
as the company told commercial director denis грибанов__gribanov , in 2011 , with the emergence of a new owner held marketing research to study the market for steel structures in the tyumen region .
it turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons line pipes per month .
after that it was decided to change the profile of the factory and installation of the equipment for their production .
already this year , shipped more than 7 thousand tons of the manufactured products .
the investment in the factory amounted to more than 120 million руб-лей__rub-ley , - said denis грибанов__gribanov .
in october , launched a new mill , which helps increase the product range .
the plant produces a fine profile of pipes , which is used for теп-личного__tep-lichnogo farms , small forms of construction and furniture industries , as well as large - for the construction industry .
plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousands tons of production per year , which would be about 10 per cent of its consumption in the tyumen region .
despite the transition to another activity , the number of employees at the plant decreased 't - now it is 157 people in plans for the purchase of new equipment , increased staff even more than 50 employees .
on the enterprise there is a retraining of the staff and the experts are from existing .
next year we plan to introduce the new unit longitudinal cutting of the steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters , which would reduce the cost of production , and another camp , with the speed of the production of pipes to 47 meters per minute .
by the end of 2014 , at the company are going to master production of tubes , which are used in the housing and public utility sector .
the company aims to close to 70 per cent of the needs of the tyumen region in this production .
the deputy director of the department of investment policy leonid остроумов__ostroumov , referring to the leaders of manufacturing , and advised to focus on modernization of machine-building enterprises .
to this aim , and forms of state support for industry , which include compensation for interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it .
in the current year to allocate for these purposes provided for 150 mln rubles , two-thirds of that amount has already been spent .
the latest commission , which will consider the subsidy contracts , taking documents from companies until 15 november .
in addition , the budget are reimbursed expenses for the participation of local manufacturers in international fairs .
the budget for the coming year provides the means of 150 million rubles , which can be used to offset leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment .
5 million will be allocated to participate in trade fairs , 3 million - on energy efficiency programme .
falling to 72 million roubles of funds for compensation ordered and paid for equipment , which is produced in the south of tyumen region for oil and gas complex .
according to leonid остроумова__ostroumova , in the long term , this form of support will be stopped , as motive for her compensation was the introduction of a tax on mining , which oil companies paid to the local budget .
currently they do not become subsidies and direct supply obligations in the region .
in view of this , the government believes the priority directly support of industrial enterprises , rather than financing them through the oil industry .
the aid budget will be associated with investment projects which will be implemented on the production .
many business executives expressed concern in connection with the situation in relations with have claimed .
bailout on their закупаемое__zakupaemoe equipment industry is competitive advantage and the south of tyumen region , with its repeal is hard to compete on price with an average strip of russia , where more than cheap labor .
in addition , the question of succession is unclear with the new owner of tnk-bp - rosneft company , which does not yet place their orders for the tyumen enterprises .
the agreement on implementation of the uvat project expires in 2013 , and his request for an extension was not received .
currently , the enterprise south area who specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector , cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year .
there remains an open question whether taxes will come from oil extracted in уватском__uvatskom area in the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the deposits .

the country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemical agents and weapons , including agents mustard gas and make nerve gas sarin .

report : obama election staff viewed the exclusion of biden in favor of hillary clinton
according to the new york times , the closest advisers of president barack obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing vice president joe biden candidacy of hillary clinton in the voter list of 2012 .
this discovery is the most spectacular sensation of all books expected mark galperin and john хайлеманна__khaylemanna on campaign 2012 " rates удвоены__udvoeny : game change 2012 " .
the upcoming edition of the times received a copy of the book to the exit and reported on thursday night that close aides of the president held a “ large-scale research in a focus group and opinion polls at the end of 2011 , ” to assess whether the exclusion of biden help raise угасающие__ugasayushchie hopes for obama ’ s re-election .
according to the political observer the times jonathan martin , the book gives a detailed description of the attempts by senior officials , campaign staff and the white house , namely the former white house chief of staff bill daley to assess what effect the vote will have on the appointment of former secretary of state clinton ’ s vice-president .
possible replacement was a mystery , carefully guarded election headquarters in chicago and in the oval office .
only six of the president ’ s closest advisers — including daly , the former head of obama ’ s campaign staff jim мессину__messinu and former senior white house advisers david аксельрода__akselroda and david плуффа__pluffa — knew that replacement considered .
the book " rates удвоены__udvoeny " argues that daly was the initiator attempts to replace biden , despite their “ close personal relationship ” , but ultimately abandoned this step when their data showed that adding clinton to the electoral list is not “ significantly improves the chances of obama . ”
in an interview with martin daly confirmed that the administration really considered to replace biden clinton .
“ i was actively spoken out for consideration of many things , and this was one of them , ” said the daily newspaper .
you must remember that at that point the president was in awful shape , so we thought : “ oh god , what do we do ? ”
although daly described the study as “ necessary ” test representative , martin told cnn that anderson куперу__kuperu election staff enough was invested in the study , whether this step dividends on a vote .
“ campaign headquarters are not spending such sums of money on surveys and focus groups if they do not consider something seriously , ” said martin in the ak 360 .
it is unclear , however , whether obama knew that his team studied the possibility of replacement .
martin told cnn that he asked daley knew whether his then boss about possible перетасовке__peretasovke .
although daly and said that he did not think the president “ was aware ” of a possible replacement , the former head of the administration acknowledged that “ perhaps ” , obama knew .
martin added that rates " удвоены__udvoeny " does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political table 've sensing to obama .
cooper asked martin , seriously whether he believes that obama did not know about the research capabilities of excluded biden from the electoral list .
“ perhaps , ” martin said .

although businessmen initially counted on growth .
for the current year is unfortunate for them : sales fell by 7 per cent .
told about all this , the head of one of the largest beer companies of the country , chairman of the union of russian beer isaac шепс__sheps at iii annual conference of the institute of adam smith " commodities of daily demand in russia , which just ended in moscow .

from 2008 to 2012 , the russian beer market has shrunk by 18 per cent , as in recent years , the country has seen a significant strengthening of the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and sales of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content , - informed listeners шепс__sheps .
in no country in the world is not such a hard limit beer market , unpredictable introducing all new нелогичных__nelogichnykh prohibitions , which ostensibly обосновываются__obosnovyvayutsya struggles with alcohol abuse .
brewer complained that many legislative bans , designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse , does not have special influence , nevertheless appear regularly all the new initiatives .
all the hurt on beer makers hit with ban introduced this year to sell alcohol at kiosks .

why would the construction of the tpu in moscow
with each passing year , city authorities promise to arrange more транспортно-пересадочных__transportno-peresadochnykh knots ( tpu ) .
until 2020 , it is planned to enter into operation 255 tpu .
what actually is the project of understanding our correspondent .
a couple of months ago the smolenskaya metro " " арбатско-покровской__arbatsko-pokrovskoy line a construction fence .
the caption read , which is construction of the project ’ s funding has node .
all this was very strange because near smolensk " " no land transport does not stop and , therefore , cannot move on him .
to get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the garden ring , one must overcome about 130 meters , including land crossing карманицкий__karmanitskiy lane .
now the smolensk " " almost all finished .
faded flower stall , демонтирован__demontirovan stand for newspapers , and the pavement in front of the entrance to брусчаткой__bruschatkoy .
here is the entire transport hub .
транспортно-пересадочные__transportno-peresadochnye nodes are плоскостными__ploskostnymi and capital - explain in the press service of the moscow department of transport .
capital tpu while are not present .
but плоскостные__ploskostnye suggest the construction of the parking lots of shopping sites , hindering the movement of passengers , the creation of small architectural forms and refurbishment .
actually , even плоскостными__ploskostnymi tpu do not forwarding company and professional благоустроители__blagoustroiteli overhaul of department of the city of moscow .
hub is not necessarily a complicated structure , explains the director of institute of economy of transport and the transport policy of the higher school of economics , mikhail блинкин__blinkin .
sometimes a roof over his head and the scoreboard , оповещающих__opoveshchayushchikh about the time of arrival of transport .
here , for example , the metro " yasenevo " recently opened a full-fledged плоскостной__ploskostnoy interchange junction .
even without the canopies , but with перехватывающими__perekhvatyvayushchimi car parks and the scoreboard indicating when придет__pridet bus .
but in pursuit of the record number of officials at tpu all that neither попадя__popadya .
back in 2011 , city hall planned to build at all about all 151 node , 59 of them with capital construction .
now , in plans by 2020 , there are as many as 255 tpu .
some 200 of them even promise to pass this year .
although the city has the program of development of tpu 't indicated no qualitative criteria - notes alexander morozov , co-chairman of the public organization " city and transport " .
report on the number of objects , but the quality of the transplant on each of them often deteriorates .
the criteria , according to the expert , there must be two : first - cutting the time of transplant , second , convenience .
first of all an opportunity to change the type of transport , not going out in the rain .
in moscow the same by arrangement of the tpu sometimes goes in exactly the opposite .
a vivid example of metro vdnkh " " .
earlier , commuter buses to the yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the exhibition .
now they have to stop on the opposite side of the street ярославки__yaroslavki cosmonauts .
farther from the subway , much further from монорельса__monorelsa , but closer to residential homes .
the gift that residents do not want bus under windows and complained in every possible instance .
with capital tpu in moscow did not immediately задалось__zadalos .
the first of them started five years ago , the subway " planernaya " .
the project aims to be a model .
and really it was an example of how interchange node , left to extremely инвесторам__investoram , turns into a banal shopping centre .
no , there are canopy перроны__perrony for buses , not to go from the subway in the rain , and three floors of parking lots .
true , химкинским__khimkinskim троллейбусам__trolleybusam № № 202 and 203 seats in moscow will not give fundamentally .
how strange they pushed them away from the metro .
but the space under the trade more left .
one of only 32 clothing store , and generally have almost everything - from pet products to the showroom .
well , in fact , who suddenly from bus passengers need to buy a new car on the road ?
we have , when building overhaul tpu , somehow always turns out shopping centre .
recently , the situation has reached its logical conclusion , when part of the building decided to give at the market .
now on the third floor of the tpu " planernaya " among размеченных__razmechennykh parking spaces on the floor goes бойкая__boykaya trade .
chinese vegetables , spices , jeans , not russian speech and security guards , angrily поглядывающие__poglyadyvayushchie on our photographer .
interchange knot finally turned into a bazaar .
the fact of the matter is that before the metro " planernaya " was market , but his demolished .
and in the prefecture of traffickers and everything within dui allowed on перехватывающую__perekhvatyvayushchuyu parking пересадочного__peresadochnogo node .
still , because of the high prices there are always empty .
the same ridiculous that the market demolished in order to build in its place ... a new плоскостной__ploskostnoy tpu .
this is castling .
the kaluzhskaya metro " " distance approach from lobby metro bus was 50 meters , says alexander morozov .
after the construction of the trade center , allegedly tpu , the distance increased to 170 meters .
to sit in the bus , it is necessary to pass through the shopping centre .
after 22 hours , when it is closed , must work around him under the open sky .
however , construction on " планерной__planernoy " and " kaluga " soon look like the problem .
in the middle of september , the commission approved градостроительно-земельная__gradostroitelno-zemelnaya mayor planning solutions for the first eight capital tpu .
four of them will be 25-этажными__25-etazhnymi , not counting two or three underground lines .
the monster will grow the metro " tushino " , there will be 418,7 thousand square metres of space .
representatives of railway stations directorate of russian railways , responsible for the construction of the tpu from metro , already told journalists : in future многоэтажках__mnogoetazhkakh will contain shops , hotels and apartments .
at the same time , officials claim that storied parking zay ­ mut from one third to a half square .
take for example the " folk " garages .
for example , the garage for 258 машино-мест__mashino-mest , which recently built on the international street , has an area of 8015 square meters .
that means , for the thousands of car parking in 2.6 " 've петровско-разумовской__petrovsko-razumovskoy " need on the order of 80,000 " " squares .
this is less than a third of the махины__makhiny , which gather there to build .
let one or two floors will be spent on various перроны__perrony for buses .
remains of at least 150 thousand square metres of commercial real estate .
and this , in a minute , almost two pishan county .
if capital tpu at stations and railroad station building , the rest of the site will explore метрополитеновцы__metropolitenovtsy .
they also promised that there will be a lot of objects " " functional purpose , including hotels , offices and even sports halls .
by the way , in the moscow department of property recently , told journalists that developing a draft decree , under which investors would be able to apply for a plot for tpu directly to the officials .
without any competitions .
because , they say , that the transport issues for the city - a priority .
the ideal tpu is , for example , the harvard " " in boston or " спадайна__spadayna " in toronto , is confident alexander morozov .
there , trolleys and trams descend underground to the metro and the distance from the approach of subway cars before the tram is only 50 metres without access to the street .
around no unnecessary trade .
but moscow officials throws in the extreme .
either we will build nothing , or too отгрохаем__otgrokhaem 25 storeys with offices and apartments .

bombardier profit declines with falling supplies and more orders for planes
corporation of bombardier , the canadian aircraft and train maker , reported on thursday a net profit reduction on the 15 percent under the influence of уменьшившегося__umenshivshegosya quantity of orders and deliveries aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division .
located in montreal , bombardier also has not published any data for flight testing of its new cseries aircraft and provided no new information about whether implemented ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation by next september .
after the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft , held about six months ago , he was flying only three times , that raises questions about whether testing phase on schedule .
the results have failed forecasts and led to the shares falling more than 8 per cent on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron доерксен__doerksen , analyst at national bank financial , on thursday lowered its estimate of “ above среднерыночного__srednerynochnogo ” to “ среднерыночного__srednerynochnogo ” because of the belief that growth is limited shares in the next quarter or two .
“ although the reduction in the number of aircraft deliveries was largely predictable , we are , of course , disappointed by the transport department figures of profit , ” said доерксен__doerksen in review of the stock market .
we believe that bombardier gets new cseries orders as the flight test program .
nevertheless , if not in the coming months will be announced about new orders , we expect that the market will become more skeptical of the program .
bombardier hopes that the cseries family of aircraft will allow her to win a place in the lower price segment of the market , which is now dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first prototype aircraft was introduced in march , and for the first time made the flight in september after several months of delay .
but the firm cseries orders so far , not too much — 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to check the company ’ s claims about fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner .
just now there are 403 15 orders and agreements with the customers and operators .
chief executive officer pierre бодуан__boduan was confident that bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first plane will be put into commercial operation .
also on thursday , executives assured analysts and the media that the program is progressing according to plan .
“ a test model of the aircraft had not stayed on the ground longer than expected , ” said бодуан__boduan during a conference call , adding that the aircraft downtime were planned ground tests and software updates .
all manufacturers plan to test different ways .
we decided to spend the first flight and make a break for updates , and so we did .
so will occur during the flight test programme .
the second of five test samples should take flight in the coming weeks , and all the rest will follow soon behind him , according to the company .
yet analysts are skeptical of the claim that the client will be able to start operating cseries aircraft through the 12 months after its first flight .
bombardier said that it evaluates the commissioning and provide new information in the next few months .
“ the slow pace of flight testing - though , apparently , and corresponds to the domestic schedule bombardier - reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015 , ” said доерксен__doerksen .
in the third quarter , bombardier окончившемся__okonchivshemsya september 30 , net income fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share , last year .
adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged — 9 cents .
gross income fell slightly - from $ 4.20 to $ 4.1 billion .
analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $ 4.56 billion , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s.
the fourth in the world ’ s second-largest aircraft maker announced that he had put 45 aircraft for the quarter , which is less than in the previous year — 57 .
the total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft .
order backlog aerospace research department totaled $ 32.9 billion at september 30 , re 't from 31 december .
“ in the field of aerospace results consistent with our goals , but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become a troubling factor , ” said бодуан__boduan .
gross income on авиакосмическому__aviakosmicheskomu direction fell by 13 percent — to $ 2 billion .
bombardier , the world ’ s largest maker of trains , said that gross income in this sector grew by nearly 11 percent — to $ 2.1 billion .
order backlog in the transportation unit was $ 32.6 billion at september 30 , slightly higher than the 31 december .
the transport division income negatively impacted the problems with the execution of several large contracts .
management stated that in the fourth quarter will be presented a new plan for development .
bombardier shares of the company , which also announced that google chief financial officer patrick пичетт__pichett enters the board of directors , fell to 8.5 percent — up from $ 4,83 at auction in the middle of thursday .
brazilian company embraer sa , third in the world ’ s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest competitor , bombardier said on thursday about reducing quarterly income on 10 percent .
